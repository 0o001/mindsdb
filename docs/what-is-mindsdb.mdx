title: What is MindsDB?
---

Data that lives in your database is a valuable asset. MindsDB enables you to use
your data and make forecasts. It speeds up the ML development process by
bringing machine learning into the database.

With MindsDB, you can build, train, optimize, and deploy your ML models without
the need for other platforms. And to get the forecasts, simply query your data
and ML models. Read along to see some examples.

## What are AI Tables?

MindsDB brings machine learning into databases by employing the concept of AI
Tables.

AI Tables are machine learning models stored as virtual tables inside a
database. They facilitate making predictions based on your data. You can perform
the time series, regression, and classification predictions within your database
and get the output almost instantly by querying an AI Table with simple SQL
statements.

## Deep Dive into the AI Tables

### Current Challenges

Let’s consider the following `income_table` table that stores the `income` and
`debt` values.

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|60000 |20000|
|80000 |25100|
|100000|30040|
|120000|36010|
+------+-----+
```

A simple visualization of the data present in the `income_table` table is as
follows:

![Income vs Debt](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt.png)

Querying the income table to get the `debt` value for a particular `income`
value results in the following:

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table
WHERE income = 80000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|80000 |25100|
+------+-----+
```

And here is what we get:

![Income vs Debt chart](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_known_value.png)

But what happens when querying the table for an `income` value that is not
present there?

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM income_table
WHERE income = 90000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

When the `WHERE` clause condition is not fulfilled for any of the rows, no
value is returned.

When a table doesn’t have an exact match, the query returns an empty set or null
value. This is where the AI Tables come into play!

### Solution Offered by MindsDB

Let’s create a `debt_model` model that allows us to approximate the `debt` value
for any `income` value. We train the `debt_model` model using the data from the
`income_table` table.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.debt_model
FROM income_table
PREDICT debt;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

MindsDB provides the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/predictor/)
statement. On execution of this statement, the predictive model works in the
background, automatically creating a vector representation of the data that can
be visualized as follows:

![Income vs Debt model](/assets/sql/income_vs_debt_predictor.png)

Let’s now look for the `debt` value of some random `income` value. To get the
approximated `debt` value, we query the `mindsdb.debt_model` model instead
of the `income_table` table.

```sql
SELECT income, debt
FROM mindsdb.debt_model
WHERE income = 90000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------+-----+
|income|debt |
+------+-----+
|90000 |27820|
+------+-----+
```

And here is how it looks:

## Why Choose MindsDB?

### The Machine Learning Lifecycle

MindsDB aims to make the process of building and deploying machine learning models easier for software developers.
The traditional machine learning workflow typically involves preparing data, building models, and deploying them.
This process often involves extracting, transforming, and loading data between different phases.

![ML Workflow](/assets/sql/machine_learning_lifecycle.png)

With MindsDB, the data preparation and model building phases are streamlined by using your database and automatically
consuming the models as tables. The deployment phase is also automated, so you can focus on preparing data and building
models rather than worrying about the technicalities of deployment. Essentially, MindsDB simplifies the machine learning
workflow by eliminating the need for manual data transformation and deployment steps.
