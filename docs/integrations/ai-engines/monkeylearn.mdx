Monkeylearn is a No-code text analysis tool. MindsDB allows you to use pre-built & custom Monkeylearn models to use its features like classifying text according to user needs and fields of interest like business, reviews, comments, and customer feedback.

## How to bring MonkeyLearn Models to MindsDB

Before creating a model, you will need to create the ML_ENGINE for Monkeylearn using the `CREATE ML_ENGINE` syntax

```sql
Create ML_ENGINE monkeylearn
FROM monkeylearn
```

<p align="center">

</p>


Once the ML_ENGINE is created, we use the `CREATE MODEL` statement to bring Monkeylearn models to MindsDB.

For this example, you will make use of Monkeylearn's pre-made model `E-commerce Support Ticket Classifier`.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.ecommerce_ticket_classifier
PREDICT tag
USING
engine = 'monkeylearn',
api_key = 'your_monkeylearn_api_key',
model_id = 'model_id',
input_column = 'text';
```

On execution, you get:

</p>

Where:

| Expression                             | Description                                              |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `mindsdb.ecommerce_ticket_classifier`  | The model name provided to the model created in MindsDB  |
| `tag`     	                           | The column that will provide the predicted result        | 
| `engine`                               | The ML framework engine used, which is Monkeylearn       | 
| `your_monkeylearn_api_key`             | The API Key of the model provided by Monkeylearn         | 
| `model_id`                             | The respective model's ID you want to make use of        | 
| `input column`                         |Specifies the input column when calling the model         | 


You can use the `DESCRIBE` syntax to verify the model's status.

```sql
DESCRIBE ecommerce_ticket_classifier;
```

On execution, you get:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/tutorials/4.describe.png" />
</p>

Use the `SELECT` statement to make a prediction on the model.

```sql
SELECT * FROM ecommerce_ticket_classifier
WHERE text = 'Where is my order? The delivery status shows shipped. When I call the delivery driver there is no response!';
```

On execution, you get:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/tutorials/5.select_prediction.png" />
</p>

### Creating a model with a dataset. 

You can also create a model with a dataset. For this example, we will be using a dataset consisting of messages for E-commerce support tickets. The dataset will be uploaded as a file onto the GUI.

Use the `CREATE MODEL` syntax:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.ecommerce_ticket_classifier2
FROM files (select * from queries2)
PREDICT tag
USING
engine = 'monkeylearn',
api_key = 'your_monkeylearn_api_key',
model_id = 'model_id',
input_column = 'text';
```

Use the `SELECT` statement to make a prediction

```sql
SELECT * FROM ecommerce_ticket_classifier2
WHERE text = 'I ordered 4 units but only received 3';
```

On execution, you get:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/tutorials/10.select_prediction.png" />
</p>

The MindsDB model created with the Monkeylearn model successfully predicted the tag of an E-commerce support ticket according to the text input.
