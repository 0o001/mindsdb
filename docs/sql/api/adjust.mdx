## Description

The `ADJUST` statement lets you retrain a model with additional training data.

Imagine you have a model that was trained with a certain dataset. Now there is more training data available and you wish to retrain this model with a new dataset. The `ADJUST` statement lets you partially retrain the model, so it takes less time and resources than the [`RETRAIN`](/sql/api/retrain) statement. In the machine learning literature, this is also referred to as *fine-tuning* a model.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
ADJUST project_name.model_name
FROM integration_name
    (SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)
[USING
    key = value,
    ...];
```

Where:

| Expressions                                 | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `project_name`                              | Name of the project where the model resides.                                                                       |
| `model_name`                                | Name of the model to be retrained.                                                                                 |
| `integration_name`                          | Name of the integration created using the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement or file upload.    |
| `(SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)` | Selecting additional data to be used for retraining.                                                               |
| `USING key = value`                         | Optional. The `USING` clause lets you pass multiple parameters to the `ADJUST` statement.                          |

<Info>
**Model Versions**

Every time the model is retrained/adjusted, its new version is created with an incremented version number. Unless overridden, the most recent version becomes active when training completes.

You can query for all model versions like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM project_name.models_versions;
```

For more information on managing model versions, check out our docs [here](/sql/api/manage-models-versions).

## Example 1: Regression Model

In this example, we use our sample PostgreSQL database. You can connect to it like this:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "3.220.66.106",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
    };
```

First, we create and train the model using a subset of the `home_rentals` data, considering properties that have been on the market less than 10 days.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.adjust_home_rentals_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT * 
    FROM demo_data.home_rentals 
    WHERE days_on_market < 10)
PREDICT rental_price;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```

We can check its status using this command:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name = 'adjust_home_rentals_model';
```

Once the status is complete, we can query for predictions.

```sql
SELECT rental_price, rental_price_explain 
FROM mindsdb.adjust_home_rentals_model
WHERE sqft = 1000
AND location = 'great'
AND neighborhood = 'berkeley_hills'
AND number_of_rooms = 2
AND number_of_bathrooms = 1
AND days_on_market = 40;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| rental_price  | rental_price_explain                                                                                                                          |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2621          | {"predicted_value": 2621, "confidence": 0.99, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "confidence_lower_bound": 2523, "confidence_upper_bound": 2719} |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
 
Let’s adjust this model with more training data. Now we consider properties that have been on the market for 10 or more days.

```sql
ADJUST mindsdb.adjust_home_rentals_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT * 
    FROM demo_data.home_rentals 
    WHERE days_on_market >= 10);
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```

To check the status and versions of the model, run this command:

```sql
SELECT name, engine, project, active, version, status
FROM mindsdb.models_versions
WHERE name = 'adjust_home_rentals_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
| name                      | engine    | project | active | version | status   |
+---------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
| adjust_home_rentals_model | lightwood | mindsdb | false  | 1       | complete |
| adjust_home_rentals_model | lightwood | mindsdb | true   | 2       | complete |
+---------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
```

Please note that the longer the property is on the market, the lower its rental price. Hence, we can expect the `rental_price` prediction to be lower.

```sql
SELECT rental_price, rental_price_explain 
FROM mindsdb.adjust_home_rentals_model
WHERE sqft = 1000
AND location = 'great'
AND neighborhood = 'berkeley_hills'
AND number_of_rooms = 2
AND number_of_bathrooms = 1
AND days_on_market = 40;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| rental_price  | rental_price_explain                                                                                                                          |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2055          | {"predicted_value": 2055, "confidence": 0.99, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "confidence_lower_bound": 1957, "confidence_upper_bound": 2153} |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Example 2: Classification Model

In this example, we again use our sample PostgreSQL database.

First, we create and train the model using a subset of the `customer_churn` data, considering only female customers.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT *
    FROM demo_data.customer_churn
    WHERE gender = 'Female')
PREDICT churn;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```

We can check its status using this command:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name = 'adjust_customer_churn_model';
```

Once the status is complete, we can query for predictions.

```sql
SELECT churn, churn_explain
FROM mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
WHERE seniorcitizen = 0
AND partner = 'Yes'
AND dependents = 'No'
AND tenure = 1
AND phoneservice = 'No'
AND multiplelines = 'No phone service'
AND internetservice = 'DSL';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| churn  | churn_explain                                                                                                                                              |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| No     | {"predicted_value": "No", "confidence": 0.9887640449438202, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "probability_class_No": 0.934, "probability_class_Yes": 0.066} |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
 
Let’s adjust this model with more training data. Now we also consider male customers.

```sql
ADJUST mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT *
    FROM demo_data.customer_churn
    WHERE gender = 'Male');
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```

To check the status and versions of the model, run this command:

```sql
SELECT name, engine, project, active, version, status
FROM mindsdb.models_versions
WHERE name = 'adjust_customer_churn_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+-----------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
| name                        | engine    | project | active | version | status   |
+-----------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
| adjust_customer_churn_model | lightwood | mindsdb | false  | 1       | complete |
| adjust_customer_churn_model | lightwood | mindsdb | true   | 2       | complete |
+-----------------------------+-----------+---------+--------+---------+----------+
```

Let’s query for a prediction again.

```sql
SELECT churn, churn_explain
FROM mindsdb.adjust_customer_churn_model
WHERE seniorcitizen = 0
AND partner = 'Yes'
AND dependents = 'No'
AND tenure = 1
AND phoneservice = 'No'
AND multiplelines = 'No phone service'
AND internetservice = 'DSL';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| churn  | churn_explain                                                                                                                                                |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| No     | {"predicted_value": "No", "confidence": 0.9887640449438202, "anomaly": null, "truth": null, "probability_class_No": 0.9294, "probability_class_Yes": 0.0706} |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Here after adjusting the model, there are no significant changes to the predictions. However, the probability class for `Yes` and `No` values has been updated. The probability of a `Yes` value has increased slightly, while the probability of a `No` value has decreased.

## Example 3: Using the OpenAI Engine

In this example, we create a model using the OpenAI engine. Then, we fine-tune it using the `ADJUST` statement.

Let's create an OpenAI model that we'll use to answer the questions.

```sql
CREATE MODEL question_answering_model_adjust
PREDICT true_answer
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    prompt_template = 'answer the question of text:{{question}} about text:{{article_title}}';
```

We can check its status using the below query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM models
WHERE name = 'question_answering_model_adjust';
```

Once the status is complete, we can query for predictions. We use the `questions` table from our sample MySQL database called `mysql_demo_db`.

```sql
SELECT input.article_title, input.question, output.true_answer
FROM mysql_demo_db.questions AS input
JOIN question_answering_model_adjust AS output
LIMIT 5;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|article_title   |question                                                   |answer                                                              |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Alessandro_Volta|Was Volta an Italian physicist?                            |Yes, Volta was an Italian physicist.                                |
|Alessandro_Volta|Is Volta buried in the city of Pittsburgh?                 |No, Volta is not buried in the city of Pittsburgh.                  |
|Alessandro_Volta|Did Volta have a passion for the study of electricity?     |Yes, Volta had a passion for the study of electricity.              |
|Alessandro_Volta|What is the battery made by Volta credited to be?          |The battery made by Volta is credited to be the first battery.      |
|Alessandro_Volta|What important electrical unit was named in honor of Volta?|The volt, a unit of electric potential, was named in honor of Volta.|
+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

<Tip>
Here is how you can connect to our sample MySQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_demo_db
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "user",
    "password": "MindsDBUser123!",
    "host": "db-demo-data.cwoyhfn6bzs0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": "3306",
    "database": "public"
};
```
</Tip>

We can fine-tune the `question_answering_model_adjust` model using the `ADJUST` statement.

```sql
ADJUST question_answering_model_adjust
FROM mysql_demo_db
    (SELECT *
    FROM questions
    WHERE article_title = 'Alessandro_Volta');
```

<Tip>
Please note that the target column (here, it is the `true_answer` column) must be present in the dataset used for fine-tuning.
</Tip>

After executing the `ADJUST` statement, there is a new version of the model in the `models_versions` table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.models_versions
WHERE name = 'question_answering_model_adjust';
```

On exection, we get:

```sql
todo
```

Once the status of the new model version is complete, we can query for predictions again.

```sql
SELECT input.article_title, input.question, output.true_answer
FROM mysql_demo_db.questions AS input
JOIN question_answering_model_adjust AS output
LIMIT 5;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
todo
```
