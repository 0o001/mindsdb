# Briefly describe what ML framework does this handler integrate to MindsDB, and how?


# Why is this integration useful? What does the ideal predictive use case for this integration look like? When would you definitely not use this integration?

# Are models created with this integration fast and scalable, in general?

# What are the recommended system specifications for models created with this framework?


# To what degree can users control the underlying framework by passing parameters via the USING syntax?

# Does this integration offer model explainability or insights via the DESCRIBE syntax?


# Does this integration support fine-tuning pre-existing models (i.e. is the update() method implemented)? Are there any caveats?


# Are there any other noteworthy aspects to this handler?


# Any directions for future work in subsequent versions of the handler?

# Please provide a minimal SQL example that uses this ML engine (pointers to integration tests in the PR also valid)
