Check out our Getting Started Guide for trying MindsDB with your data or model. 1. Create an Account \u00b6 Create your free MindsDB Cloud account . Local Installation Follow our Docker instructions . if you prefer to proceed with a local installation. 2. Connect MindsDB to a MySQL Client \u00b6 You can use the MindsDB SQL Editor or open your preferred MySQL client and connect it to MindsDB. Using the MindsDB SQL Editor Connecting to a Third-party MySQL Client Just log in to your account, and you will be automatically directed to the Editor . To connect to MindsDB from another SQL client use cloud.mindsdb.com as a host, 3306 port and your MindsDB Cloud credentials for username/password. \"user\":[your_mindsdb_cloud_username], \"password:\"[your_mindsdb_cloud_password]\", \"host\":\"cloud.mindsdb.com\", \"port\":\"3306\" If you do not already have a preferred SQL client, we recommend DBeaver Community Edition . 3. Connecting a Database CREATE DATABASE \u00b6 For this quickstart, we have already prepared some example data for you. To add it to your account, use the CREATE DATABASE syntax by copying and pasting this command into your SQL client: CREATE DATABASE example_data WITH ENGINE = \"postgres\" , PARAMETERS = { \"user\" : \"demo_user\" , \"password\" : \"demo_password\" , \"host\" : \"3.220.66.106\" , \"port\" : \"5432\" , \"database\" : \"demo\" } ; On execution, we get: Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 3 . 22 sec ) 4. Previewing Available Data \u00b6 You can now preview the available data with a standard SELECT . To preview the Home Rentals dataset, copy and paste this command into your SQL client: SELECT * FROM example_data . demo_data . home_rentals LIMIT 10 ; On execution, we get: + -----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+ | number_of_rooms | number_of_bathrooms | sqft | location | days_on_market | initial_price | neighborhood | rental_price | + -----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+ | 0 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 484 | great | 10 | 2271 | south_side | 2271 | | 1 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 674 | good | 1 | 2167 | downtown | 2167 | | 1 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 554 | poor | 19 | 1883 | westbrae | 1883 | | 0 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 529 | great | 3 | 2431 | south_side | 2431 | | 3 . 0 | 2 . 0 | 1219 | great | 3 | 5510 | south_side | 5510 | | 1 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 398 | great | 11 | 2272 | south_side | 2272 | | 3 . 0 | 2 . 0 | 1190 | poor | 58 | 4463 | westbrae | 4124 | | 1 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 730 | good | 0 | 2224 | downtown | 2224 | | 0 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 298 | great | 9 | 2104 | south_side | 2104 | | 2 . 0 | 1 . 0 | 878 | great | 8 | 3861 | south_side | 3861 | + -----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+ 5. Creating a Predictor CREATE PREDICTOR \u00b6 Now you are ready to create your first predictor. Use the CREATE PREDICTOR syntax by copying and pasting this command into your SQL client: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . home_rentals_predictor FROM example_data ( SELECT * FROM demo_data . home_rentals ) PREDICT rental_price ; On execution, we get: Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 9 . 79 sec ) 6. Checking the Status of a Predictor \u00b6 A predictor may take a couple of minutes for the training to complete. You can monitor the status of your predictor by copying and pasting this command into your SQL client: SELECT status FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'home_rentals_predictor' ; On execution, we get: + ----------+ | status | + ----------+ | training | + ----------+ Or: + ----------+ | status | + ----------+ | complete | + ----------+ Predictor Status Must be 'complete' Before Making a Prediction 7. Making a Prediction via SELECT \u00b6 The SELECT syntax will allow you to make a prediction based on features. Make your first prediction by copying and pasting this command into your SQL client: SELECT rental_price FROM mindsdb . home_rentals_predictor WHERE number_of_bathrooms = 2 AND sqft = 1000 ; On execution, we get: + --------------+ | rental_price | + --------------+ | 1130 | + --------------+ Congratulations If you got this far, you have trained a predictive model using SQL and have used it to tell the future!","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"#quickstart","text":"Follow the following steps to start predicting in SQL straight away.

With this, anyone who knows SQL can utilize the built-in machine learning techniques without needing any other outsourced tools or training. In short, MindsDB aims to provide intelligent databases to make better data-driven decisions in the existing database without the effort of creating a new one. Deployment on Digital Ocean \u00b6 Digital Ocean is a Cloud computing platform that provides cloud computing services with predictable pricing, developer-friendly features, and scalability as you need. Today, we will be deploying the MindsDB server on a Digital Ocean Droplet (a scalable virtual machine on DO Platform) and trying to connect to it using our local MySQL client or Dbeaver. Step 1: Sign up for a Digital Ocean account if you don't have one yet. They provide 100$ Credits when you sign up so that you can try it for free. Step 2: Once you've created an account, you should see a dashboard like this. If you look towards the left panel, you can find the Droplets option. Now click on Droplets. Step 3: Once you are in the Droplets Dashboard, hit Create Droplet . Step 4: Now the Create Droplet dashboard opens. Here you need to choose the configurations you want for your virtual machine and can also select any additional applications you want to install on your VM from the Marketplace. For now, we will move ahead with the following configurations that would boot up a standard VM for us with the required performance. Distributions : Ubuntu 20.04(LTS) x64 Choose a Plan : Shared CPU (Basic) CPU Options : $20/mo (4GB/2CPUs, 80GB SSD Disk, 4TB Transfer) Datacenter Region : Closest Region to you to reduce Latency (Bangalore for me) Authentication : SSH Key (If you have one) or Root Password (Set your Root Password below to login to the VM) Select Additional Option : Choose Monitoring and IPv6 which are free services Finalize and Create : Set the number of Droplets you want (1 for now) and the Name of Droplet Select a Project : Leave it at default for now Or you can simply go to the top and select Marketplace and search for Docker there and select Docker on Ubuntu directly, as we would be using Docker to install the MindsDB server on our Droplet, instead of choosing a Ubuntu LTS distribution and then installing docker on top of it manually. Hit Create Droplet and wait for a while till it spins one for us in the cloud. Step 5: Once your Droplet is created, you can always click on the Droplets in the left Navigation pane and Click on the Droplet name to go into the Droplet Dashboard details. Now click on the Console from the top right corner. This should open up a terminal for you where you can interact with your VM. Step 6: Now while you are inside the console, simply check whether Docker is installed or not using the following command. docker run hello-world If the command successfully returns Hello From Docker , then you're good to go. Now we start with the installation of MindsDB on our Droplet. Step 7: Now we will use the following commands in sequence to get done with the installation of MindDB Sever. docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb This should pull the latest Production image to our Droplet. You can also use the latest Beta version as well using the following command. docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb_beta Step 8: After that, we need to publish the ports so that we can hit the endpoints and communicate with the MindsDB Server in our Droplet. So, we will first expose the MindsDB GUI Port and then the MySQL Port that we will be using for now with the commands below. MindsDB GUI with MySQL API docker run -p 47334:47334 -p 47335:47335 mindsdb/mindsdb You can always follow the MindsDB Getting Started documentation if you need further information or want to install MindsDB by any other means other than Docker. Step 9: You might see a warning on the console after you run the above command that some data sources may not be available and you can always find details on how to add the specific data source on the MindDB Repo . For now, we will add the data source for MSSQL using the command below. Open another console for the droplet and run it if MindsDB is still running in the first console. pip install mindsdb-datasources[mssql] NOTE: You have to install python first to be able to use pip . Run the following to get it installed. apt install python3-pip You may encounter a few errors with regards to the versioning of pandas and scramp which you can ignore. Step 10: Now you can access the MindsDB GUI using the Droplet IPv4:47334 . Make sure you have turned off any VPN service you're using or else you may not be able to connect to the GUI using the URL. Step 11: This step enables us to connect a database client to our MindsDB server. For now, I would be using DBeaver to do the same. You can also connect your local MySQL server following the steps here . NOTE: You should follow the local deployment steps instead of cloud as this is a local instance hosted on the cloud and not the official MindsDB cloud edition. The default username is mindsdb and the default password is empty. We will first need to define the connection settings in Dbeaver before we can connect it. Always make sure you're using MySQL only or MySQL8 or higher from the available options. Click on Next and fill in the following details in the upcoming screen. Hostname : Your Droplet IPv4 Port : 47335 Username : mindsdb Password : Leave it empty. Now hit the Test Connection and once it returns success, click on Finish . NOTE: If you're running it for the first time, it may ask you to download some additional driver files. Check Force Download/Overwrite and hit `Download to proceed. Tables in MindsDB \u00b6 Once connected to the mindsdb database, it will contain 3 tables predictors , commands and datasources . You can simply run a query show tables; to see these as shown in the snippet above. The Predictors table contains all the newly trained ML models as a new record. Each column in the Predictors table contains information about each of these models. You can always find more information by visiting MindsDB Documentation page. This concludes the tutorial on how to deploy the MindsDB server on a Digital Ocean Droplet and connect to it using a local client. Please drop a like let me know in the comments if you found this useful or have any other suggestions. NOTE: The dashboard images belong to the official platforms of Digital Ocean and MindsDB respectively and are used here only for illustrative purposes.

By bringing machine learning to the database, MindsDB accelerates the speed of machine learning development. With MindsDB, you will easily build, train, optimize and deploy your models. Your predictions will be available via the queries you already use. What are AI Tables? \u00b6 MindsDB brings machine learning to existing SQL databases with a concept called AI Tables. AI Tables integrate the machine learning models as virtual tables inside a database, create predictions, and can be queried with simple SQL statements. Almost instantly, time series, regression, and classification predictions can be done directly in your database. Deep Dive into the AI Tables \u00b6 The problem \u00b6 Let\u2019s consider the following income table that stores the income and debt values. SELECT income , debt FROM income_table ; On execution, we get: + ------+-----+ | income | debt | + ------+-----+ | 60000 | 20000 | | 80000 | 25100 | | 100000 | 30040 | | 120000 | 36010 | + ------+-----+ A simple visualization of the data present in the income table is as follows: Querying the income table to get the debt value for a particular income value results in the following: SELECT income , debt FROM income_table WHERE income = 80000 ; On execution, we get: + ------+-----+ | income | debt | + ------+-----+ | 80000 | 25100 | + ------+-----+ Green dot and dashed line as query result But what happens when we query the table for income value that is not present? SELECT income , debt FROM income WHERE income = 90000 ; On execution, we get: Empty set ( 0 . 00 sec ) In other words, Nothing! no valuable information at all. Dashed red line describing the absense of a value (blue dot) for the query When a table doesn\u2019t have an exact match the query will return an empty set or null value. This is where the AI Tables come into play! The solution \u00b6 Let\u2019s create a debt model that allows us to approximate the debt value for any income value. We\u2019ll train this debt model using the income table\u2019s data. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . debt_model FROM income_table PREDICT debt ; On execution, we get: Query OK , 0 rows affected ( x . xxx sec ) MindsDB provides the CREATE PREDICTOR statement. When we execute this statement, the predictive model works in the background, automatically creating a vector representation of the data that can be visualized as follows: Green line describing the Predictor (model) created Let\u2019s now look for the debt value of some random income value. To get the approximated debt value, we query the mindsdb . debt_model instead of the income_table . SELECT income , debt FROM mindsdb . debt_model WHERE income = 90000 ; On execution, we get: + ------+-----+ | income | debt | + ------+-----+ | 90000 | 27820 | + ------+-----+ Dashed blue line describing the query of the model with the predicted value (dark blue dot) What is MindsDB, why is MindsDB important? \u00b6 Shift on Data Analysis Paradigm \u00b6 There is an ongoing transformational shift within the modern business world from the \u201cwhat happened and why\u201d based on historical data analysis to the \u201cwhat will we predict can happen and how can we make it happen\u201d based on machine learning predictive modeling. The success of your predictions depends both on the data you have available and the models you train this data on. Data Scientists and Data Engineers need best-in-class tools to prepare the data for feature engineering, the best training models, and the best way of deploying, monitoring, and managing these implementations for optimal prediction confidence. The Machine Learning (ML) Lifecycle \u00b6 The ML lifecycle can be represented as a process that consists of the data preparation phase, modeling phase, and deployment phase. The diagram below presents all the steps included in each of the stages. Companies looking to implement machine learning have found their current solutions require substantial amounts of data preparation, cleaning, and labeling, plus hard to find machine learning/AI data scientists to conduct feature engineering; build, train, and optimize models; assemble, verify, and deploy into production; and then monitor in real-time, improve, and refine. Machine learning models require multiple iterations with existing data to train. Additionally, extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from one system to another is complicated, leads to multiple copies of information, and is a compliance and tracking nightmare. A recent study has shown it takes 64% of companies a month, to over a year, to deploy a machine learning model into production. Leveraging existing databases and automating the feature engineering, building, training, and optimization of models, assembling them, and deploying them into production is called AutoML and has been gaining traction within enterprises for enabling non-experts to use machine learning models for practical applications. Why is it called MindsDB? \u00b6 Well, as most names, we needed one, we like science fiction, and the culture series , where there are these AI super-smart entities called Minds. How about the DB part? Although in the future we will support all kinds of data, currently our objective is to add intelligence to existing data stores/databases, hence the term DB. As to becoming a Mind to your DB . Why the bear? We wanted to honor the open source tradition of animals related to projects! We went for a bear because of UC Berkeley where this all was initially coded. But we liked a cooler bear so went for a Polar Bear. How Can You Help Democratize Machine Learning? \u00b6 You can help in the following ways: Trying MindsDB and reporting issues . If you know python, you can also help us debug open issues. Issues labels with the good first issue tag should be the easiest to start with . You can help us with documentation, tutorial and examples.

Please visit the Kafka Connect MindsDB page on the official Confluent site. It contains all the instructions on how to install the connector from the Confluent hub. Setting up Kafka in Docker \u00b6 Let's review the instructions here as well. You may use the official connector docker image: docker pull mindsdb/mindsdb-kafka-connector The source code of the Kafka connector is in the kafka_connector GitHub repository . Please read the instructions before building the connector from scratch. It is possible to integrate and use the Kafka connector as part of your own Kafka cluster, or you may use our test docker environment. To try out our test docker environment , follow the steps below. Before you bring the docker container up, please note that there are two types of connector configuration: For MindsDB Cloud For a separate MindsDB installation No matter which option you choose, these files require real values to be set in place of a username, password, Kafka connection details, etc. The SASL mechanism details are optional, as local Kafka installation may not have this mechanism configured - or you can use this data for the SASL username and password. Now that your config files store real data, you can execute the command below from the root of the kafka_connector GitHub repository to build the connector and launch it in the test environment locally. docker-compose up -d Let's go over some examples. Examples \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Launch MindsDB instance where HTTP API interface runs on docker network interface inet ip . Usually, the IP address is 172.17.0.1 , and the port is 47334 . You can modify the HTTP API interface details in the MindsDB config file . Now, to launch your MindsDB, run the following command: python -m mindsdb --config = YOURCONFIGFILE.JSON Please note that the config file must be in the JSON format. It must include this part of the config file from the MindsDB repository in a proper JSON format. Train a new model. You may use this tutorial as an example. Run the test environment as instructed in the Setting up Kafka in Docker section above. Create the Connector Instance \u00b6 To create a connector, you need to send a POST request to a specific connectors URL with connector configuration in JSON format, as below. import requests MINDSDB_URL = \"http://172.17.0.1:47334\" CONNECTOR_NAME = \"MindsDBConnector\" INTEGRATION_NAME = 'test_kafka' KAFKA_PORT = 9092 KAFKA_HOST = \"127.0.0.1\" CONNECTOR_NAME = \"MindsDBConnector\" CONNECTORS_URL = \"http://127.0.0.1:9021/api/connect/connect-default/connectors\" STREAM_IN = \"topic_in\" STREAM_OUT = \"topic_out\" PREDICTOR_NAME = \"YOUR_MODEL_NAME\" # set actual model name here params = { \"name\" : CONNECTOR_NAME , \"config\" : { \"connector.class\" : \"com.mindsdb.kafka.connect.MindsDBConnector\" , \"topics\" : STREAM_IN , \"mindsdb.url\" : MINDSDB_URL , \"kafka.api.host\" : KAFKA_HOST , \"kafka.api.port\" : KAFKA_PORT , \"kafka.api.name\" : INTEGRATION_NAME , \"predictor.name\" : PREDICTOR_NAME , \"output.forecast.topic\" : STREAM_OUT , \"security.protocol\" : \"SASL_PLAINTEXT\" , \"sasl.mechanism\" : \"PLAIN\" , \"sasl.plain.username\" : \"admin\" , \"sasl.plain.password\" : \"admin-secret\" , } } headers = { \"Content-Type\" : \"application/json\" } res = requests . post ( CONNECTORS_URL , json = params , headers = headers ) This code creates a MindsDB Kafka connector that uses the PREDICTOR_NAME model, receives source data from the STREAM_IN Kafka topic, and sends prediction results to the STREAM_OUT Kafka topic. Send Source Data and Receive Prediction Results \u00b6 There are many Kafka client implementations - choose the most suitable one depending on your goals. The code below generates and sends the source records to topic_in by default. You can use any other Kafka topic by providing its name as a CMD parameter. import sys import json import kafka connection_info = { \"bootstrap_servers\" : \"127.0.0.1:9092\" , \"security_protocol\" : \"SASL_PLAINTEXT\" , \"sasl_mechanism\" : \"PLAIN\" , \"sasl_plain_username\" : \"admin\" , \"sasl_plain_password\" : \"admin-secret\" } producer = kafka .

Prerequisite \u00b6 Make sure you have cloned and installed the latest staging version of MindsDB repository locally. What are handlers? \u00b6 At the heart of the MindsDB philosophy lies the belief that predictive insights are best leveraged when produced as close as possible to the data layer. Usually, this \"layer\" is a SQL-compatible database, but it could also be a non-SQL database, data stream, or any other tool that interacts with data stored somewhere else. The above description fits an enormous set of tools that people use across the software industry. The complexity increases further by bringing Machine Learning into the equation, as the set of popular ML tools is similarly huge. We aim to support most technology stacks, requiring a simple integration procedure so that anyone is able to easily contribute the necessary \"glue\" to enable any predictive system for usage within data layers. This motivates the concept of handlers , which is an abstraction for the two types of entities mentioned above: data layers and predictive systems. Handlers are meant to enforce a common and sufficient set of behaviors that all MindsDB-compatible entities should support. By creating a handler, the target system is effectively integrated into the wider MindsDB ecosystem. Structure of a handler \u00b6 Technically speaking, a handler is a self-contained Python package that will have everything required for MindsDB to interact with it, including aspects like dependencies, unit tests, and continuous integration logic. It is up to the author to determine the nature of the package (e.g. close or open source, version control, etc.), although we encourage opening pull requests to expand the default set of supported tools. The entrypoint is a class definition that should inherit from either integrations.libs.base_handler.DatabaseHandler or integrations.libs.base_handler.PredictiveHandler depending on the type of system that is integrated. integrations.libs.base_handler.BaseHandler defines all the common methods that have to be overwritten in order to achieve a functional implementation. Apart from the above, structure is not enforced and the package can be built arranged into whatever design is preferred by the author. Structure within the MindsDB repository \u00b6 The code for integrations is located in the main MindsDB repository under /integrations directory. integrations # Contains integrations source code \u251c\u2500 handlers/ # Each integration has its own handler dir \u2502 \u251c\u2500 mysql_handler/ # MySQL integration code \u2502 \u251c\u2500 lightwood_handler/ # Lightwood integration code \u2502 \u251c\u2500 .../ # Other handlers \u251c\u2500 libs/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 base_handler.py # Base class that each handler inherit from \u2502 \u251c\u2500 storage_handler.py # Storage classes for each handler \u2514\u2500 utilities # Handlers utilities dir \u2502 \u251c\u2500 install.py # Installs all handlers dependencies Core methods \u00b6 Apart from __init__() , there are seven core methods that the handler class has to implement, these are: connect(), disconnect(), check_connection(), native_query(), query(), get_tables(), get_columns() . It is recommended to check actual examples in the codebase to get an idea of what may go into each of these methods, as they can change a bit depending on the nature of the system being integrated. Respectively, their main purpose is: connect : perform any necessary steps to connect to the underlying system disconnect : if needed, gracefully close connections established in connect check_connection : evaluate if the connection is alive and healthy. Will be frequently called. native_query : should parse any native statement string and act upon it (e.g. raw SQL-like commands). query : takes a parsed SQL-like command (in the form of an abstract syntax tree) and executes it. An example would be a CREATE PREDICTOR statement for predictive handlers, which is not native syntax as databases have no notion of a PREDICTOR entity. get_tables : All available tables s should be listed and returned. Each handler should decide what a table will mean for the underlying system when interacting with it from the data layer. Typically, this means actual tables for data handlers, and machine learning models (or predictive handlers. get_columns : Each table registered in the handler will have one or more columns (with their respective data types) that will be returned when calling this method. As stated in the above section, authors can opt for adding private methods, new files, folders, or any combination of these to structure all the necessary work that will enable the methods above to work as intended. Predictor-specific behavior \u00b6 For predictive handlers, there is an additional method that is fundamental: join() : triggers a specific model to generate predictions given some input data. This behavior manifests in the SQL API when doing any type of JOIN operation between tables from a predictive and data handler. Parsing SQL \u00b6 Whenever a string that contains SQL needs to be parsed, it is heavily recommended to opt for using the mindsdb_sql package, which contains its own parser that fully supports the MindsDB SQL dialect and partially supports the common SQL dialect. There is also a \"render\" feature to map other dialects into the already supported ones. Storing internal state \u00b6 Most handlers need to store internal metadata, ranging from a list of registered tables to implementation-specific details that will greatly vary from one case to another. The recommendation for storing these bits of information is to opt for storage handlers (located in integrations.libs.storage_handler ). We currently support two options, either a Sqlite or a Redis backend. In both cases, the premise is the same: a key-value store system is setup so that interfaces are kept simple and clean, exposing only get() and set() methods for usage within the data and predictive handlers. Note: for ML frameworks, opt for storing the path to your model weights inside the KV storage, saving weights in optimized formats preferred by the system, like .h5 ) Formatting output \u00b6 When it comes to building the response of the public methods, the output should be wrapped by the HandlerResponse and HandlerStatusResponse classes (located in mindsdb.integrations.libs.response ), which are used by MindsDB executioner to orchestrate and coordinate multiple handler instances in parallel. Other common methods \u00b6 Under mindsdb.integrations.libs.utils , contributors can find various methods that may be useful while implementing new handlers, with a focus on predictive handlers. How to write a handler \u00b6 We wrap up this page by going through all the above information step by step. Remember, if you are adding new data integration you need to extend the DatabaseHandler . In a case of adding a predictive framework integration extend PredictiveHandler . In both cases we need 7 core methods: connect \u2013 Setup storage and connection disconnect \u2013 Terminate connection check_connection \u2013 Health check native_query \u2013 Act upon a raw SQL-like command query \u2013 Act upon a parsed SQL-like command get_tables \u2013 List all accessible entities within handler get_columns \u2013 Column info for a specific table entity And additionally for predictive handlers: 8. join \u2013 Call other handlers to merge data with predictions. Below, you can find a list of entities required to create a database handler. Step 1: Create Handler class: \u00b6 Each DatabaseHandler should inherit from DatabaseHandler class. Set class property name : \u00b6 It will be used inside MindsDB as name of handler. For example, the name is used use an ENGINE in CREATE DATABASE statement: CREATE DATABASE integration_name WITH ENGINE = 'postgres' , + PARAMETERS = { 'host' : '127.0.0.1' , 'user' : 'root' , 'password' : 'password' } ; Step 1.1: Implement __init__ \u00b6 This method should initialize the handler. the connection_data argument will contain PARAMETERS from CREATE DATABASE statement as user , password etc. def __init__ ( self , name : str , connection_data : Optional [ dict ], ** kwargs ) \"\"\" Initialize the handler Args: name (str): name of particular handler instance connection_data (dict): parameters for connecting to the database **kwargs: arbitrary keyword arguments. \"\"\" Step 1.2: Implement connect \u00b6 The connect method should set up the connection as: def connect ( self ) -> HandlerStatusResponse : \"\"\" Set up any connections required by the handler Should return output of check_connection() method after attempting connection. Should switch self.is_connected. Returns: HandlerStatusResponse \"\"\" Step 1.3: Implement disconnect \u00b6 The disconnect method should close the existing connection as: def disconnect ( self ): \"\"\" Close any existing connections Should switch self.is_connected. \"\"\" self . is_connected = False return self . is_connected Step 1.4: Implement check_connection \u00b6 The check_connection method is used to perform the health check for the connection: def check_connection ( self ) -> HandlerStatusResponse : \"\"\" Check connection to the handler Returns: HandlerStatusResponse \"\"\" Step 1.5: Implement native_query \u00b6 The native_query method is used to run command on native database language: def native_query ( self , query : Any ) -> HandlerStatusResponse : \"\"\"Receive raw query and act upon it somehow. Args: query (Any): query in native format (str for sql databases, dict for mongo, etc) Returns: HandlerResponse \"\"\" Step 1.6: Implement query \u00b6 The query method is used to run parsed SQL command: def query ( self , query : ASTNode ) -> HandlerStatusResponse : \"\"\"Receive query as AST (abstract syntax tree) and act upon it somehow. Args: query (ASTNode): sql query represented as AST. May be any kind of query: SELECT, INTSERT, DELETE, etc Returns: HandlerResponse \"\"\" Step 1.7: Implement get_tables \u00b6 The get_tables method is used to list tables: def get_tables ( self ) -> HandlerStatusResponse : \"\"\" Return list of entities Return list of entities that will be accesible as tables. Returns: HandlerResponse: shoud have same columns as information_schema.tables (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-tables-table.html) Column 'TABLE_NAME' is mandatory, other is optional. \"\"\" Step 1.8: Implement get_columns \u00b6 The get_tables method is used to list tables: def get_columns ( self , table_name : str ) -> HandlerStatusResponse : \"\"\" Returns a list of entity columns Args: table_name (str): name of one of tables returned by self.get_tables() Returns: HandlerResponse: shoud have same columns as information_schema.columns (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-columns-table.html) Column 'COLUMN_NAME' is mandatory, other is optional. Hightly recomended to define also 'DATA_TYPE': it should be one of python data types (by default it str). \"\"\" Step 2: Create connection_args dict: \u00b6 The connection_arg dictinonary should contain all required arguments to establish the connection. Step 3: Create connection_args_example dict: \u00b6 The connection_args_example dictinonary should contain an example of all required arguments to establish the connection. Step 4: Export all required variables: \u00b6 In __init__ file export: Handler - handler class version - version of handler name - name of the handler (same as Handler.name) type - type of the handler (is it DATA of ML handler) icon_path - path to file with database icon title - short description of handler description - description of handler connection_args - dict with connection args connection_args_example - example of connection args import_error - error message, in case if is not possible to import Handler class E.g: title = 'Trino' version = 0.1 description = 'Integration for connection to TrinoDB' name = 'trino' type = HANDLER_TYPE . DATA icon_path = 'icon.png' __all__ = [ 'Handler' , 'version' , 'name' , 'type' , 'title' , 'description' , 'connection_args_example' 'Handler' , 'version' , 'name' , 'type' , 'title' , 'description' , 'icon_path' ] For real examples, we encourage you to inspect the following handlers inside the MindsDB repository: MySQL Postgres MLflow Lightwood","title":"Building a new integration"},{"location":"contribute/integrations/#building-a-new-integration","text":"This section will walk you through adding a new integration to MindsDB as data layers or predictive frameworks.","title":"Building a new integration"},{"location":"contribute/integrations/#prerequisite","text":"Make sure you have cloned and installed the latest staging version of MindsDB repository locally.","title":"Prerequisite"},{"location":"contribute/integrations/#what-are-handlers","text":"At the heart of the MindsDB philosophy lies the belief that predictive insights are best leveraged when produced as close as possible to the data layer.

The first step would be to create a script where you train a model and save it using one of the saving methods that MLflow exposes. For this example, we will use the model in this simple tutorial where the method is mlflow.sklearn.log_model ( here ), given that the model is built with scikit-learn. Once trained, you need to make sure the model is served and listening for input in a URL of your choice (note, this can mean your model can run on a different machine than the one executing MindsDB). Let's assume this URL to be http://localhost:5000/invocations for now. This means you would execute the following command in your terminal, from the directory where the model was stored: mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model With <run-id> given in the output of the command python train.py used for actually training the model. Next, we're going to bring this model into MindsDB: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow PREDICT ` 1 ` -- `1` is the target column name USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , data_dtype = { \"0\" : \"integer\" , \"1\" : \"integer\" } ; We can now run predictions as usual, by using the WHERE statement or joining on a data table with an appropriate schema: SELECT ` 1 ` FROM byom_mlflow WHERE ` 0 `= 2 ; Advanced example - Keras NLP model \u00b6 Same use case as in section 1.2, be sure to download the dataset to reproduce the steps here. In this case, we will take a look at the best practices when your model needs custom data preprocessing code (which, realistically, will be fairly common). The key difference is that we now need to use the mlflow.pyfunc module to both 1) save the model using mlflow.pyfunc.save_model and 2) subclass mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel to wrap the model in an MLflow-compatible way that will enable our custom inference logic to be called. Saving the model \u00b6 In the same script where you train the model (which you can find in the final section of 2.2) there should be a call at the end where you actually use mlflow to save every produced artifact: mlflow . pyfunc . save_model ( path = \"nlp_kaggle\" , python_model = Model (), conda_env = conda_env , artifacts = artifacts ) Here, artifacts will be a dictionary with all expected produced outputs when running the training phase. In this case, we want both a model and a tokenizer to preprocess the input text. On the other hand, conda_env specifies the environment under which your model should be executed once served in a self-contained conda environment, so it should include all required packages and dependencies. For this example, they look like this: # these will be accessible inside the Model() wrapper artifacts = { 'model' : model_path , 'tokenizer_path' : tokenizer_path , } # specs for environment that will be created when serving the model conda_env = { 'name' : 'nlp_keras_env' , 'channels' : [ 'defaults' ], 'dependencies' : [ 'python=3.8' , 'pip' , { 'pip' : [ 'mlflow' , 'tensorflow' , 'cloudpickle' , 'nltk' , 'pandas' , 'numpy' , 'scikit-learn' , 'tqdm' , ], }, ], } Finally, to actually store the model you need to provide the wrapper class that will 1) load all produced artifacts into an accessible \"context\" and 2) implement all required inference logic: class Model ( mlflow . pyfunc . PythonModel ): def load_context ( self , context ): # we use paths in the context to load everything self . model_path = context . artifacts [ 'model' ] self . model = load_model ( self . model_path ) with open ( context . artifacts [ 'tokenizer_path' ], 'rb' ) as f : self . tokenizer = pickle . load ( f ) def predict ( self , context , model_input ): # preprocess input, tokenize, pad, and call the model df = preprocess_df ( model_input ) corpus = create_corpus ( df ) sequences = self . tokenizer . texts_to_sequences ( corpus ) tweet_pad = pad_sequences ( sequences , maxlen = MAX_LEN , truncating = 'post' , padding = 'post' ) df = tweet_pad [: df . shape [ 0 ]] y_pre = self . model . predict ( df ) y_pre = np . round ( y_pre ) . astype ( int ) . flatten () . tolist () return list ( y_pre ) As you can see, here we are loading multiple artifacts and using them to guarantee the input data will be in the same format that was used when training. Ideally, you would abstract this even further into a single preprocess method that is called both at training time and inference time. Finally, serving is simple. Go to the directory where you called the above script, and execute mlflow models serve --model-uri ./nlp_kaggle . At this point, the rest is essentially the same as in the previous example. You can link the MLflow model with these SQL statements: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp PREDICT ` target ` USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich text\" , \"target\" : \"binary\" } ; To get predictions, you can directly pass input data using the WHERE clause: SELECT target FROM mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Or you can JOIN with a data table. For this, you should ensure the table actually exists and that the database it belongs to has been connected to your MindsDB instance. For more details, refer to the same steps in the Ray Serve example (section 1.2). SELECT ta . text , tb . target AS predicted FROM db_byom . test . nlp_kaggle_test AS ta JOIN mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp AS tb ; Full Script \u00b6 Finally, for reference, here's the full script that trains and saves the model.

The key difference is that we now need to use the mlflow.pyfunc module to both 1) save the model using mlflow.pyfunc.save_model and 2) subclass mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel to wrap the model in an MLflow-compatible way that will enable our custom inference logic to be called.","title":"Advanced example - Keras NLP model"},{"location":"custom-model/mlflow/#saving-the-model","text":"In the same script where you train the model (which you can find in the final section of 2.2) there should be a call at the end where you actually use mlflow to save every produced artifact: mlflow . pyfunc . save_model ( path = \"nlp_kaggle\" , python_model = Model (), conda_env = conda_env , artifacts = artifacts ) Here, artifacts will be a dictionary with all expected produced outputs when running the training phase. In this case, we want both a model and a tokenizer to preprocess the input text. On the other hand, conda_env specifies the environment under which your model should be executed once served in a self-contained conda environment, so it should include all required packages and dependencies. For this example, they look like this: # these will be accessible inside the Model() wrapper artifacts = { 'model' : model_path , 'tokenizer_path' : tokenizer_path , } # specs for environment that will be created when serving the model conda_env = { 'name' : 'nlp_keras_env' , 'channels' : [ 'defaults' ], 'dependencies' : [ 'python=3.8' , 'pip' , { 'pip' : [ 'mlflow' , 'tensorflow' , 'cloudpickle' , 'nltk' , 'pandas' , 'numpy' , 'scikit-learn' , 'tqdm' , ], }, ], } Finally, to actually store the model you need to provide the wrapper class that will 1) load all produced artifacts into an accessible \"context\" and 2) implement all required inference logic: class Model ( mlflow . pyfunc . PythonModel ): def load_context ( self , context ): # we use paths in the context to load everything self . model_path = context . artifacts [ 'model' ] self . model = load_model ( self . model_path ) with open ( context . artifacts [ 'tokenizer_path' ], 'rb' ) as f : self . tokenizer = pickle . load ( f ) def predict ( self , context , model_input ): # preprocess input, tokenize, pad, and call the model df = preprocess_df ( model_input ) corpus = create_corpus ( df ) sequences = self . tokenizer . texts_to_sequences ( corpus ) tweet_pad = pad_sequences ( sequences , maxlen = MAX_LEN , truncating = 'post' , padding = 'post' ) df = tweet_pad [: df . shape [ 0 ]] y_pre = self . model . predict ( df ) y_pre = np . round ( y_pre ) . astype ( int ) . flatten () . tolist () return list ( y_pre ) As you can see, here we are loading multiple artifacts and using them to guarantee the input data will be in the same format that was used when training. Ideally, you would abstract this even further into a single preprocess method that is called both at training time and inference time. Finally, serving is simple. Go to the directory where you called the above script, and execute mlflow models serve --model-uri ./nlp_kaggle . At this point, the rest is essentially the same as in the previous example. You can link the MLflow model with these SQL statements: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp PREDICT ` target ` USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich text\" , \"target\" : \"binary\" } ; To get predictions, you can directly pass input data using the WHERE clause: SELECT target FROM mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Or you can JOIN with a data table. For this, you should ensure the table actually exists and that the database it belongs to has been connected to your MindsDB instance.

You can check its status with the query SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE name = 'byom_ray_serve_nlp'; , much like you'd do with a \"normal\" MindsDB predictor. Once the predictor's status becomes trained we can query it for predictions as usual: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Which would, hopefully, output 1 . Alternatively, we can try out this tweet to expect 0 as an output: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'This is lovely dear friend' ; If your results do not match this example, it could help to train the model for a longer amount of epochs.","title":"Ray Serve"},{"location":"custom-model/ray-serve/#mindsdb-and-ray-serve","text":"","title":"MindsDB and Ray Serve"},{"location":"custom-model/ray-serve/#simple-example-logistic-regression","text":"Ray serve is a simple high-throughput service that can wrap over your own ml models.

And ingest it into a table with the following schema: id INT , keyword VARCHAR ( 255 ), location VARCHAR ( 255 ), text VARCHAR ( 5000 ), target INT Note: specifics of the schema and how to ingest the csv will vary depending on your database. Next, we can register and train the above custom model using the following query: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp FROM maria ( SELECT text , target FROM test . nlp_kaggle_train ) PREDICT target USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich_text\" , \"target\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; Training will take a while given that this model is a neural network rather than a simple logistic regression. You can check its status with the query SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE name = 'byom_ray_serve_nlp'; , much like you'd do with a \"normal\" MindsDB predictor. Once the predictor's status becomes trained we can query it for predictions as usual: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Which would, hopefully, output 1 . Alternatively, we can try out this tweet to expect 0 as an output: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'This is lovely dear friend' ; If your results do not match this example, it could help to train the model for a longer amount of epochs.","title":"Example - Keras NLP model"},{"location":"mongo/mongo/","text":"Train a model from the MongoDB API \u00b6 Note: This is work in progress, please join our slack channel if you have any questions.

The free tier offers all you need to get started. The installation instructions are easy to follow, head over to the downloads page and choose your operating system. Follow the instructions for installation. Then create a free account to get an auth token that you can use to config your ngrok instance. Once installed and configured, run the following command to obtain the host and port number: ngrok tcp [ port-number ] Example: ngrok tcp 5431 # assuming you are running a db on the port 5432, for example, postgres At this point you will see a line saying something like this: Session Status online Account myaccount ( Plan: Free ) Version 2 .3.40 Region United States ( us ) Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040 Forwarding tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io:15093 -> localhost 5432 The forwarded address information will be required when connecting to MindsDB's GUI. We will make use of the Forwarding information, in this case it is tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io:15093 where where tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io will be used for the host parameter and 15093 as the port number. Proceed to create a database connection in the MindsDB GUI. Once you have selected a database as a datasource, you can execute the syntax with the host and port number retrieved.

Note that this is just a task for fun so use it at your own risk. In this tutorial, you will learn how to forecast Bitcoin using MindsDB. And all you need to know is just SQL. Behind the scenes, MindsDB will create the complete machine learning workflow, like determine, normalize & encode the data, train & test the model, etc. But we don\u2019t need to bother with all this complexity. Of course, if you want to, you can tune things manually inside MindsDB with a declarative syntax called JSON-AI, but we will not cover it in this article. DISCLAIMER: Please note that predicting Bitcoin price is just an example for showing MindsDB technology and you are solely responsible for any results you may get in real life, if you use this information for real trading purposes. Please note, that you can also follow this tutorial with other data you have. Pre-requisites \u00b6 First, you need MindsDB installed. If you want to use MindsDB locally, you need to install MindsDB with Docker or Python . However, if you want to use MindsDB without installing it locally, you can use Cloud Mindsdb . In this tutorial, I'm using MindsDB Cloud, because it is easy to set up in just 2 minutes and it has a great free tier. Second, you need a MySQL client to connect to MindsDB MYSQL API. Connect your database \u00b6 You must first connect MindsDB to the database where the record is stored. In the left navigation, click Database, click ADD DATABASE. And you must provide all the necessary parameters to connect to the database. Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to Integrations Name - add a name to the integration, here I'm using 'mysql' but you can name it as you like Database - the database name Host - database hostname Port - database port Username - database user Password - user's password Then, click on CONNECT. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API, train a new model, and make a prediction. Connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API \u00b6 In this tutorial I'm using MySQL command-line client, but you can also follow up with the one that works the best for you, like Dbeaver. The first step is to use the MindsDB Cloud user to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API, using this command: You need to specify the hostname and user name explicitly, as well as a password for connecting. Click enter and you are connected to MindsDB API. If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email address you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. Data \u00b6 Now, let's show the databases. There are 4 databases, and the MySQL database is the database that I've connected to MindsDB. Let's check the MySQL database. There are 3 tables, and in this tutorial, we will use the Bitcoin table. And let's check what is inside this table. These tables have 5 columns: date, open price, the highest price of the day, lowest price of the day, and close price. The column we want to forecast is close price. Create the model \u00b6 Now, to create the model let's move to MindsDB database. and let's see what's inside. There are 2 tables, predictors, and commands. Predictors contain your predictors record, and commands contain your last commands used. To train a new machine learning model we will need to CREATE PREDICTOR as a new record inside the predictors table, and using this command: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) as ds_name PREDICT column_target as column_alias ORDER BY column_orderby WINDOW num_window HORIZON num_horizon USING { \"is_timeseries\" : \"Yes\" } The values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. integration_name (string) - The name of the connection to your database. ds_name (string) - the name of the dataset you want to create, it's optional if you don't specify this value MindsDB will generate by itself. column_target (string) - The feature you want to predict. column_alias - Alias name of the feature you want to predict. column_orderby - The column to order the data, for time series this should be the date/time column. num_window - keyword specifies the number of rows to \"look back\" into when making a prediction after the rows are ordered by the order_by column and split into groups. This could be used to specify something like \"Always use the previous 10 rows\". num_horizon - keyword specifies the number of future predictions. So, use this command to create the models: If there's no error, that means your model is created and training. To see if your model is finished, use this command: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = predictor_name ; And values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. If the model is finished, it will look like this. The model has been created! and the accuracy is 99%! Create the prediction \u00b6 Now you are in the last step of this tutorial, creating the prediction. To create a prediction you can use this command: SELECT target_variable , target_variable_explain FROM model_table WHERE when_data = '{\"column3\": \"value\", \"column2\": \"value\"}' ; And you need to set these values: - target_variable - The original value of the target variable. - target_variable_confidence - Model confidence score. - target_variable_explain - JSON object that contains additional information as confidence_lower_bound, confidence_upper_bound, anomaly, truth. - when_data - The data to make the predictions from(WHERE clause params). Finally, we have created a Bitcoin forecasting model using SQL and MindsDB. Yayyy! Conclusions \u00b6 As you can see it is very easy to start making predictions with machine learning even without being a data scientist! Feel free to check this yourself!

MindsDB enables you to make predictions automatically using just SQL commands, all the ML workflow is automated, and abstracted as virtual \u201cAI tables\u201d in your database so you may start getting insights from forecasts right away. In this tutorial, we'll be using MindsDB and a MySQL database to predict body fat percentage based on several body part measurement criteria. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Before you start make sure that you've: Visted Getting Started Guide Visited Getting Started with Cloud Downloaded the dataset. The dataset being used for this tutorial. Get it from Kaggle . Data Overview \u00b6 For this tutorial, we'll be using the Body Fat Prediction dataset available at Kaggle . Each row represents one person and we'll train an ML model to help us predict an individual's body fat percentage using MindsDB. Below is a short description of each feature of the data: Density: Individual's body density as determined by underwater weighing (float) BodyFat: The individual's determined body fat percentage (float). This is what we want to predict Age: Age of the individual (int) Weight: Weight of the individual in pounds (float) Height: Height of the individual in inches (float) Neck: Circumference of the individual's neck in cm (float) Chest: Circumference of the individual's chest in cm (float) Abdomen: Circumference of the individual's abdomen in cm (float) Hip: Circumference of the individual's hips in cm (float) Thigh: Circumference of the individual's thigh in cm (float) Knee: Circumference of the individual's knee in cm (float) Ankle: Circumference of the individual's ankle in cm (float) Biceps: Circumference of the individual's biceps in cm (float) Forearm: Circumference of the individual's forearm in cm (float) Wrist: Circumference of the individual's wrist in cm (float) Add data to MindsDB GUI \u00b6 MindsDB has a functionality to uploud your data file directly via the GUI where you can immediately query the data and create a machine learning model. The following is the steps to upload your data directly to MindsDB: Access the MindsDB GUI via cloud or local via the URL 127.0.0.1:47334/. Select the button Add data or select the plug icon on the left side bar. The page will navigate to 'Select your data source'. Select the option 'Files'. Select the tab under 'Import a file'. Please note the dataset files should not exceed the maximum size limit which is 10MB. Provide a name for the data file which will be saved as a table. Once you have successfully uploaded the file, you can query the data from the files table to ensure the information pulls through. Run the following syntax: SELECT * FROM files . bodyfat LIMIT 10 ; Once you have confirmed the file has successfully uploaded and the data can be retrieved, we can move on to creating a predictor. Create and train a machine learning model. \u00b6 With the CREATE PREDICTOR statement, we can create a machine learning model: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM files ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM file_name ) PREDICT column_name ; The required values that we need to provide are: \u200b - predictor_name (string): The name of the model - integration_name (string): The name of the connection to your database. - column_name (string): The feature you want to predict. For our case, we'll enter the following syntax: CREATE PREDICTOR bodyfat_predictor FROM files ( SELECT * FROM bodyfat ) PREDICT Bodyfat ; Select the Run button or select Shift+Enter to run the syntax. Once is is successful you will receive a message in the console 'Query successfully completed'. You should see output similar to the following: At this point, the predictor will immediately begin training. Check the status of the training by entering the command: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'bodyfat_predictor' ; When complete, you should see output similar to the following: As you can see, the predictor training has been completed with an accuracy of approximately 99%. At this point, you have successfully trained an ML model for our Body Fat Prediction dataset! Using SQL Commands to Make Predictions \u00b6 Now, we can query the model and make predictions based on our input data by using SQL statements. Let's imagine an individual aged 25, with a body density of 1.08, a weight of 170lb, a height of 70in, a neck circumference of 38.1cm, a chest circumference of 103.5cm, an abdomen circumference of 85.4cm, a hip circumference of 102.2cm, a thigh circumference of 63.0cm, a knee circumference of 39.4cm, an ankle circumference of 22.8cm, a biceps circumference of 33.3cm, a forearm circumference of 28.7cm, and a wrist circumference of 18.3cm. We can predict this person's body fat percentage by issuing the following command: SELECT BodyFat , BodyFat_confidence , BodyFat_explain FROM mindsdb . bodyfat_predictor WHERE Density = 1 . 08 AND Age = 25 AND Weight = 170 AND Height = 70 AND Neck = 38 . 1 AND Chest = 103 . 5 AND Abdomen = 85 . 4 AND Hip = 102 . 2 AND Thigh = 63 . 0 AND Knee = 39 . 4 AND Ankle = 22 . 8 AND Biceps = 33 . 3 AND Forearm = 28 . 7 AND Wrist = 18 . 3 ; This should return output similar to: As you can see, with around 99% confidence, MindsDB predicted the body fat percentage for this individual at 8.97%. You can at this point feel free to alter the prospective individual's bodypart measurement parameters and make additional prediction queries if you'd like. Making Batch Predictions using the JOIN syntax \u00b6 The above example showed how to make predictions for a single individual's bodyfat, but what if you had a table of bodypart measurements for a number of individuals, and wanted to make predictions for them all? This is possible using the JOIN command , which allows for the combining of rows from a database table and the prediction model table on a related column. The basic syntax to use the JOIN syntax is: SELECT t . column_name1 , t . column_name2 FROM integration_name . table AS t JOIN mindsdb . predictor_name AS p WHERE t . column_name IN ( value1 , value2 , ...); For our purposes, we'll re-use the original data set, taking the Age, Density, Weight, Height, Neck circumference, Chest circumference, Abdomen circumference, and Hip circumference fields. We'll also include the original BodyFat percentage to compare our predicted values against the originals. Execute the following command: SELECT t . Age , t . Density , t . Weight , t . Height , t . Neck , t . Chest , t . Abdomen , t . Hip , t . BodyFat , p . BodyFat AS predicted_BodyFat FROM bodyfat_integration . bodyfat AS t JOIN mindsdb . bodyfat_predictor AS p LIMIT 5 ; This should return an output table similar to the following: As you can see, a prediction has been generated for each row in the input table. Additionally, our predicted bodyfat percentages align closely with the original values! Note that even though we chose only to display the Age, Density, Weight, Height, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, and Hip measurements in this example, the predicted_BodyFat field was determined by taking into consideration all of the data fields in the original bodyfat table (as this table was JOINed with the bodyfat_predictor table, from which we selected the specified fields). In order to make predictions based ONLY on the specified fields, we would have to create a new table containing only those fields, and JOIN that with the bodyfat_predictor table!

In order to do this your model will require some sort of API wrapper, for now we have two API specifications we support: MLflow and Ray Serve . The former supports importing already trained models and predicting with them from mindsdb. The later supports both training and predicting with external models. In order to use custom models there are three mandatory arguments one must past inside the USING statement: - url.predict , this is the url to call for getting predictions from your model - format , this can be either mlflow or ray_serve - dtype_dict , this is a JSON specifying all columns expected by their models, and their respective data types. For now, the mapping supports data types used by lightwood , our AutoML library. There's an additional optional argument if you want to train the model via MindsDB (only for Ray Serve): - url.train , which is the endpoint that will be called to train your model 1. Ray Serve \u00b6 1.1 Simple example - Logistic regression \u00b6 Ray serve is a simple high-throughput service that can wrap over your own ml models. In this example, we will train and predict with an external scikit-learn model. First, let's look at the actual model wrapped inside a class that complies with the above requirements: import ray from fastapi import Request , FastAPI from ray import serve import time import pandas as pd import json from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression app = FastAPI () ray . init () serve . start ( detached = True ) async def parse_req ( request : Request ): data = await request . json () target = data . get ( 'target' , None ) di = json . loads ( data [ 'df' ]) df = pd . DataFrame ( di ) return df , target @serve . deployment ( route_prefix = \"/my_model\" ) @serve . ingress ( app ) class MyModel : @app . post ( \"/train\" ) async def train ( self , request : Request ): df , target = await parse_req ( request ) feature_cols = list ( set ( list ( df . columns )) - set ([ target ])) self . feature_cols = feature_cols X = df . loc [:, self . feature_cols ] Y = list ( df [ target ]) self . model = LogisticRegression () self . model . fit ( X , Y ) return { 'status' : 'ok' } @app . post ( \"/predict\" ) async def predict ( self , request : Request ): df , _ = await parse_req ( request ) X = df . loc [:, self . feature_cols ] predictions = self . model . predict ( X ) pred_dict = { 'prediction' : [ float ( x ) for x in predictions ]} return pred_dict MyModel . deploy () while True : time . sleep ( 1 ) The important bits here are having train and predict endpoints. The train endpoint accept two parameters in the JSON sent via POST: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe - target -- the name of the target column The predict endpoint needs only one parameter: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe The training endpoints must return a JSON that contains the keys status set to ok . The predict endpoint must return a dictionary containing the prediction key, storing the predictions. Additional keys can be returned for confidence and confidence intervals. Once you start this RayServe-wrapped model you can train it using a query like this one: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve FROM mydb ( SELECT number_of_rooms , initial_price , rental_price FROM test_data . home_rentals ) PREDICT number_of_rooms USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/my_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/my_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"number_of_rooms\" : \"categorical\" , \"initial_price\" : \"integer\" , \"rental_price\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; And you can query predictions as usual, either by conditioning on a subset of input colums: SELECT * FROM byom_ray_serve WHERE initial_price = 3000 AND rental_price = 3000 ; Or by JOINING to do batch predicions: SELECT tb . number_of_rooms , t . rental_price FROM mydb . test_data . home_rentals AS t JOIN mindsdb . byom_ray_serve AS tb WHERE t . rental_price > 5300 ; Please note that, if your model is behind a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) you might have to increase the maximum limit for POST requests in order to receive the training data. MindsDB itself can send as much as you'd like and has been stress-tested with over a billion rows. 1.2. Example - Keras NLP model \u00b6 For this example, we will consider a natural language processing (NLP) task where we want to train a neural network with Keras to detect if a tweet is related to a natural disaster (fires, earthquakes, etc.). Please download this dataset to follow the example. The code for the model here is a bit more complex than in section 1.1, but the same rules apply: we create a Ray Server based service that wraps around a Kaggle NLP Model which can be trained and then used for predictions: import re import time import json import string import requests from collections import Counter , defaultdict \u200b import ray from ray import serve \u200b import gensim import numpy as np import pandas as pd from tqdm import tqdm from nltk.util import ngrams from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize from fastapi import Request , FastAPI from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer \u200b from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding , LSTM , Dense , SpatialDropout1D from tensorflow.keras.initializers import Constant from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam \u200b app = FastAPI () stop = set ( stopwords . words ( 'english' )) \u200b \u200b async def parse_req ( request : Request ): data = await request . json () target = data . get ( 'target' , None ) di = json . loads ( data [ 'df' ]) df = pd .

And ingest it into a table with the following schema: id INT , keyword VARCHAR ( 255 ), location VARCHAR ( 255 ), text VARCHAR ( 5000 ), target INT Note: specifics of the schema and how to ingest the csv will vary depending on your database. Next, we can register and train the above custom model using the following query: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp FROM maria ( SELECT text , target FROM test . nlp_kaggle_train ) PREDICT target USING url . train = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/train' , url . predict = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlp_kaggle_model/predict' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich_text\" , \"target\" : \"integer\" } , format = 'ray_server' ; Training will take a while given that this model is a neural network rather than a simple logistic regression. You can check its status with the query SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE name = 'byom_ray_serve_nlp'; , much like you'd do with a \"normal\" MindsDB predictor. Once the predictor's status becomes trained we can query it for predictions as usual: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Which would, hopefully, output 1 . Alternatively, we can try out this tweet to expect 0 as an output: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'This is lovely dear friend' ; If your results do not match this example, it could help to train the model for a longer amount of epochs. 2. MLFlow \u00b6 2.1 Simple example - Logistic Regression \u00b6 MLFlow is a tool that you can use to train and serve models, among other features like organizing experiments, tracking metrics, etc. Given there is no way to train an MLflow-wrapped model using its API, you will have to train your models outside of MindsDB by pulling your data manually (i.e. with a script), ideally using a MLflow run or experiment. The first step would be to create a script where you train a model and save it using one of the saving methods that MLflow exposes. For this example, we will use the model in this simple tutorial where the method is mlflow.sklearn.log_model ( here ), given that the model is built with scikit-learn. Once trained, you need to make sure the model is served and listening for input in a URL of your choice (note, this can mean your model can run on a different machine than the one executing MindsDB). Let's assume this URL to be http://localhost:5000/invocations for now. This means you would execute the following command in your terminal, from the directory where the model was stored: mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model With <run-id> given in the output of the command python train.py used for actually training the model. Next, we're going to bring this model into MindsDB: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow PREDICT ` 1 ` -- `1` is the target column name USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , data_dtype = { \"0\" : \"integer\" , \"1\" : \"integer\" } We can now run predictions as usual, by using the WHERE statement or joining on a data table with an appropriate schema: SELECT ` 1 ` FROM byom_mlflow WHERE ` 0 `= 2 ; 2.2. Advanced example - Keras NLP model \u00b6 Same use case as in section 1.2, be sure to download the dataset to reproduce the steps here. In this case, we will take a look at the best practices when your model needs custom data preprocessing code (which, realistically, will be fairly common). The key difference is that we now need to use the mlflow.pyfunc module to both 1) save the model using mlflow.pyfunc.save_model and 2) subclass mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel to wrap the model in an MLflow-compatible way that will enable our custom inference logic to be called. Saving the model \u00b6 In the same script where you train the model (which you can find in the final section of 2.2) there should be a call at the end where you actually use mlflow to save every produced artifact: mlflow . pyfunc . save_model ( path = \"nlp_kaggle\" , python_model = Model (), conda_env = conda_env , artifacts = artifacts ) Here, artifacts will be a dictionary with all expected produced outputs when running the training phase. In this case, we want both a model and a tokenizer to preprocess the input text. On the other hand, conda_env specifies the environment under which your model should be executed once served in a self-contained conda environment, so it should include all required packages and dependencies. For this example, they look like this: # these will be accessible inside the Model() wrapper artifacts = { 'model' : model_path , 'tokenizer_path' : tokenizer_path , } # specs for environment that will be created when serving the model conda_env = { 'name' : 'nlp_keras_env' , 'channels' : [ 'defaults' ], 'dependencies' : [ 'python=3.8' , 'pip' , { 'pip' : [ 'mlflow' , 'tensorflow' , 'cloudpickle' , 'nltk' , 'pandas' , 'numpy' , 'scikit-learn' , 'tqdm' , ], }, ], } Finally, to actually store the model you need to provide the wrapper class that will 1) load all produced artifacts into an accessible \"context\" and 2) implement all required inference logic: class Model ( mlflow . pyfunc . PythonModel ): def load_context ( self , context ): # we use paths in the context to load everything self . model_path = context . artifacts [ 'model' ] self . model = load_model ( self . model_path ) with open ( context . artifacts [ 'tokenizer_path' ], 'rb' ) as f : self . tokenizer = pickle . load ( f ) def predict ( self , context , model_input ): # preprocess input, tokenize, pad, and call the model df = preprocess_df ( model_input ) corpus = create_corpus ( df ) sequences = self . tokenizer . texts_to_sequences ( corpus ) tweet_pad = pad_sequences ( sequences , maxlen = MAX_LEN , truncating = 'post' , padding = 'post' ) df = tweet_pad [: df . shape [ 0 ]] y_pre = self . model . predict ( df ) y_pre = np . round ( y_pre ) . astype ( int ) . flatten () . tolist () return list ( y_pre ) As you can see, here we are loading multiple artifacts and using them to guarantee the input data will be in the same format that was used when training. Ideally, you would abstract this even further into a single preprocess method that is called both at training time and inference time. Finally, serving is simple. Go to the directory where you called the above script, and execute mlflow models serve --model-uri ./nlp_kaggle . At this point, the rest is essentially the same as in the previous example. You can link the MLflow model with these SQL statements: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp PREDICT ` target ` USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich text\" , \"target\" : \"binary\" } ; To get predictions, you can directly pass input data using the WHERE clause: SELECT target FROM mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Or you can JOIN with a data table. For this, you should ensure the table actually exists and that the database it belongs to has been connected to your MindsDB instance.

The train endpoint accept two parameters in the JSON sent via POST: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe - target -- the name of the target column The predict endpoint needs only one parameter: - df -- a serialized dictionary that can be converted into a pandas dataframe The training endpoints must return a JSON that contains the keys status set to ok . The predict endpoint must return a dictionary containing the prediction key, storing the predictions. Additional keys can be returned for confidence and confidence intervals.

You can check its status with the query SELECT * FROM mindsdb.predictors WHERE name = 'byom_ray_serve_nlp'; , much like you'd do with a \"normal\" MindsDB predictor. Once the predictor's status becomes trained we can query it for predictions as usual: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Which would, hopefully, output 1 . Alternatively, we can try out this tweet to expect 0 as an output: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . byom_ray_serve_nlp WHERE text = 'This is lovely dear friend' ; If your results do not match this example, it could help to train the model for a longer amount of epochs.","title":"1.2.

MLFlow"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#21-simple-example-logistic-regression","text":"MLFlow is a tool that you can use to train and serve models, among other features like organizing experiments, tracking metrics, etc. Given there is no way to train an MLflow-wrapped model using its API, you will have to train your models outside of MindsDB by pulling your data manually (i.e. with a script), ideally using a MLflow run or experiment. The first step would be to create a script where you train a model and save it using one of the saving methods that MLflow exposes. For this example, we will use the model in this simple tutorial where the method is mlflow.sklearn.log_model ( here ), given that the model is built with scikit-learn. Once trained, you need to make sure the model is served and listening for input in a URL of your choice (note, this can mean your model can run on a different machine than the one executing MindsDB). Let's assume this URL to be http://localhost:5000/invocations for now. This means you would execute the following command in your terminal, from the directory where the model was stored: mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model With <run-id> given in the output of the command python train.py used for actually training the model. Next, we're going to bring this model into MindsDB: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow PREDICT ` 1 ` -- `1` is the target column name USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , data_dtype = { \"0\" : \"integer\" , \"1\" : \"integer\" } We can now run predictions as usual, by using the WHERE statement or joining on a data table with an appropriate schema: SELECT ` 1 ` FROM byom_mlflow WHERE ` 0 `= 2 ;","title":"2.1 Simple example - Logistic Regression"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#22-advanced-example-keras-nlp-model","text":"Same use case as in section 1.2, be sure to download the dataset to reproduce the steps here. In this case, we will take a look at the best practices when your model needs custom data preprocessing code (which, realistically, will be fairly common). The key difference is that we now need to use the mlflow.pyfunc module to both 1) save the model using mlflow.pyfunc.save_model and 2) subclass mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel to wrap the model in an MLflow-compatible way that will enable our custom inference logic to be called.","title":"2.2. Advanced example - Keras NLP model"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/byom/#saving-the-model","text":"In the same script where you train the model (which you can find in the final section of 2.2) there should be a call at the end where you actually use mlflow to save every produced artifact: mlflow . pyfunc . save_model ( path = \"nlp_kaggle\" , python_model = Model (), conda_env = conda_env , artifacts = artifacts ) Here, artifacts will be a dictionary with all expected produced outputs when running the training phase. In this case, we want both a model and a tokenizer to preprocess the input text. On the other hand, conda_env specifies the environment under which your model should be executed once served in a self-contained conda environment, so it should include all required packages and dependencies. For this example, they look like this: # these will be accessible inside the Model() wrapper artifacts = { 'model' : model_path , 'tokenizer_path' : tokenizer_path , } # specs for environment that will be created when serving the model conda_env = { 'name' : 'nlp_keras_env' , 'channels' : [ 'defaults' ], 'dependencies' : [ 'python=3.8' , 'pip' , { 'pip' : [ 'mlflow' , 'tensorflow' , 'cloudpickle' , 'nltk' , 'pandas' , 'numpy' , 'scikit-learn' , 'tqdm' , ], }, ], } Finally, to actually store the model you need to provide the wrapper class that will 1) load all produced artifacts into an accessible \"context\" and 2) implement all required inference logic: class Model ( mlflow . pyfunc . PythonModel ): def load_context ( self , context ): # we use paths in the context to load everything self . model_path = context . artifacts [ 'model' ] self . model = load_model ( self . model_path ) with open ( context . artifacts [ 'tokenizer_path' ], 'rb' ) as f : self . tokenizer = pickle . load ( f ) def predict ( self , context , model_input ): # preprocess input, tokenize, pad, and call the model df = preprocess_df ( model_input ) corpus = create_corpus ( df ) sequences = self . tokenizer . texts_to_sequences ( corpus ) tweet_pad = pad_sequences ( sequences , maxlen = MAX_LEN , truncating = 'post' , padding = 'post' ) df = tweet_pad [: df . shape [ 0 ]] y_pre = self . model . predict ( df ) y_pre = np . round ( y_pre ) . astype ( int ) . flatten () . tolist () return list ( y_pre ) As you can see, here we are loading multiple artifacts and using them to guarantee the input data will be in the same format that was used when training. Ideally, you would abstract this even further into a single preprocess method that is called both at training time and inference time. Finally, serving is simple. Go to the directory where you called the above script, and execute mlflow models serve --model-uri ./nlp_kaggle . At this point, the rest is essentially the same as in the previous example. You can link the MLflow model with these SQL statements: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp PREDICT ` target ` USING url . predict = 'http://localhost:5000/invocations' , format = 'mlflow' , dtype_dict = { \"text\" : \"rich text\" , \"target\" : \"binary\" } ; To get predictions, you can directly pass input data using the WHERE clause: SELECT target FROM mindsdb . byom_mlflow_nlp WHERE text = 'The tsunami is coming, seek high ground' ; Or you can JOIN with a data table. For this, you should ensure the table actually exists and that the database it belongs to has been connected to your MindsDB instance.

From advanced machinery to specially selected crops. All the technology produces a lot of data that can be used for better adjustment of the farming process. One use case of machine learning in agriculture could be the selection of the best crop for a specific field to maximize the potential yield. Such problems are often called Classification Problems in machine learning. With MindsDB you can easily make automated machine learning predictions straight from your existing database. Even without advanced ML engineering skills, you can start leveraging predictive models that help you make better business decisions. In this tutorial, you will learn how to predict the best crop type based on field parameters using MindsDB . Pre-requisites \u00b6 Before you start make sure you have: Access to MindsDB. In this tutorial, we will use MindsDB Cloud GUI . If you want you can also deploy mindsdb on your premises, Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi . Downloaded the dataset. You can get it from Kaggle . Add your file to MindsDB \u00b6 MindsDB can integrates with many databases, in most scenarios your data will be stored in a database, if you decide to load this dataset into your database of choice, please follow instructions here as to how to connect mindsdb to your database. In this tutorial, we will be adding the dataset directly to MindsDB's GUI. For this example MindsDB Cloud GUI will be used.If you need to create an account you can find the guide on how to do it here . Alternatively, you can also use MindsDB's local deployment and access the GUI in your browser with 127.0.0.1:47334 . The first step will be to access MindsDB cloud where we will also make use of the SQL Editor: Once you are logged onto the Cloud GUI,navigate to either the Add Data button or the plug icon on the left side bar to select it. The screen will navigate to the Select your datasource page, select the option Files. Select Import Files. Click on Import a File to select your dataset from your local drive. Your dataset should be a maximum size of 10MB. Under Table name type in the name you would like to give your dataset which will be stored in MindsDB files. Once the dataset has been successfully uploaded into a table, you can query the dataset directly from the table. In the SQL Editor,type in the following syntax and select the button Run or Shift+Enter to execute the code: SELECT * FROM files . crops ; This confirms that the dataset has been successfully uploaded with all its rows.

We aim to predict the probability of churn for new customers of a telecom company. Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation either locally or via cloud.mindsdb.com . You can learn how to set up your account at MindsDB Cloud by following this guide . Another way is to set up MindsDB locally using Docker or Python . Let's get started. The Data \u00b6 Connecting the data \u00b6 There are a couple of ways you can get the data to follow through with this tutorial. Connecting as a database via CREATE DATABASE Connecting as a file You can connect to a demo database that we've prepared for you. It contains the data used throughout this tutorial which is the example_db . demo_data . customer_churn table. CREATE DATABASE example_db WITH ENGINE = \"postgres\" , PARAMETERS = { \"user\" : \"demo_user\" , \"password\" : \"demo_password\" , \"host\" : \"3.220.66.106\" , \"port\" : \"5432\" , \"database\" : \"demo\" } ; Now you can run queries directly on the demo database. Let's preview the data that we'll use to train our predictor. SELECT * FROM example_db . demo_data . customer_churn LIMIT 10 ; In this tutorial, we use the customer churn dataset. You can download it here . And this guide explains how to upload a file to MindsDB. Now, you can query the uploaded file as if it were a table. SELECT * FROM files . churn LIMIT 10 ; From now on, we will use the files.churn file as a table. Make sure you replace it with example_db . demo_data . customer_churn if you use the demo database. Understanding the Data \u00b6 We will use the customer churn dataset where each row represents one customer. In the following sections of this tutorial, we will predict if the customer is going to stop using the company products. Below is the sample data stored in the customer churn dataset. + ----------+------+-------------+-------+----------+------+------------+----------------+---------------+--------------+------------+----------------+-----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+----------------+-------------------------+--------------+------------+-----+ | customerID | gender | SeniorCitizen | Partner | Dependents | tenure | PhoneService | MultipleLines | InternetService | OnlineSecurity | OnlineBackup | DeviceProtection | TechSupport | StreamingTV | StreamingMovies | Contract | PaperlessBilling | PaymentMethod | MonthlyCharges | TotalCharges | Churn | + ----------+------+-------------+-------+----------+------+------------+----------------+---------------+--------------+------------+----------------+-----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+----------------+-------------------------+--------------+------------+-----+ | 7590 - VHVEG | Female | 0 | Yes | No | 1 | No | No phone service | DSL | No | Yes | No | No | No | No | Month - to - month | Yes | Electronic check | 29 . 85 | 29 . 85 | No | | 5575 - GNVDE | Male | 0 | No | No | 34 | Yes | No | DSL | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | No | One year | No | Mailed check | 56 . 95 | 1889 . 5 | No | | 3668 - QPYBK | Male | 0 | No | No | 2 | Yes | No | DSL | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Month - to - month | Yes | Mailed check | 53 . 85 | 108 . 15 | Yes | | 7795 - CFOCW | Male | 0 | No | No | 45 | No | No phone service | DSL | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | One year | No | Bank transfer ( automatic ) | 42 . 3 | 1840 . 75 | No | | 9237 - HQITU | Female | 0 | No | No | 2 | Yes | No | Fiber optic | No | No | No | No | No | No | Month - to - month | Yes | Electronic check | 70 . 7 | 151 . 65 | Yes | + ----------+------+-------------+-------+----------+------+------------+----------------+---------------+--------------+------------+----------------+-----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+----------------+-------------------------+--------------+------------+-----+ Where: Column Description Data Type Usage CustomerId The identification number per customer character varying Feature Gender The gender of a customer character varying Feature SeniorCitizen It indicates whether the customer is a senior citizen (1) or not (0) integer Feature Partner It indicates whether the customer has a partner (Yes) or not (No) character varying Feature Dependents It indicates whether the customer has dependents (Yes) or not (No) character varying Feature Tenure Number of months the customer has stayed with the company integer Feature PhoneService It indicates whether the customer has a phone service (Yes) or not (No) character varying Feature MultipleLines It indicates whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes) or not (No, No phone service) character varying Feature InternetService Customer\u2019s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No) character varying Feature OnlineSecurity It indicates whether the customer has online security (Yes) or not (No, No internet service) character varying Feature OnlineBackup It indicates whether the customer has online backup (Yes) or not (No, No internet service) character varying Feature DeviceProtection It indicates whether the customer has device protection (Yes) or not (No, No internet service) character varying Feature TechSupport It indicates whether the customer has tech support (Yes) or not (No, No internet service) character varying Feature StreamingTv It indicates whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes) or not (No, No internet service) character varying Feature StreamingMovies It indicates whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes) or not (No, No internet service) character varying Feature Contract The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year) character varying Feature PaperlessBilling It indicates whether the customer has paperless billinig (Yes) or not (No) character varying Feature PaymentMethod Customer\u2019s payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)) character varying Feature MonthlyCharges The monthly charge amount money Feature TotalCharges The total amount charged to the customer money Feature Churn It indicates whether the customer churned (Yes) or not (No) character varying Label Labels and Features A label is the thing we're predicting \u2014 the y variable in simple linear regression. A feature is an input variable \u2014 the x variable in simple linear regression. Training a Predictor Via CREATE PREDICTOR \u00b6 Let's create and train your first machine learning predictor. For that, we are going to use the CREATE PREDICTOR syntax where we specify what sub-query to train FROM (features) and what we want to PREDICT (labels). CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . customer_churn_predictor FROM files ( SELECT * FROM churn ) PREDICT Churn ; We use all of the columns as features, except for the Churn column whose value is going to be predicted. Checking the Status of a Predictor \u00b6 A predictor may take a couple of minutes for the training to complete. You can monitor the status of your predictor by using this SQL command: SELECT status FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'customer_churn_predictor' ; If we run it right after creating a predictor, we'll most probably get this output: + ----------+ | status | + ----------+ | training | + ----------+ But if we wait a couple of minutes, this should be the output: + ----------+ | status | + ----------+ | complete | + ----------+ Now, if the status of our predictor says complete , we can start making predictions! Making Predictions \u00b6 You can make predictions by querying the predictor as if it were a table. The SELECT syntax lets you make predictions for the label based on the chosen features. SELECT Churn , Churn_confidence , Churn_explain FROM mindsdb . customer_churn_predictor WHERE SeniorCitizen = 0 AND Partner = 'Yes' AND Dependents = 'No' AND tenure = 1 AND PhoneService = 'No' AND MultipleLines = 'No phone service' AND InternetService = 'DSL' ; On execution, we get: + -------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Churn | Churn_confidence | Churn_explain | + -------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Yes | 0 . 7865168539325843 | { \"predicted_value\" : \"Yes\" , \"confidence\" : 0 . 7865168539325843 , \"anomaly\" : null , \"truth\" : null } | + -------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Let's try another prediction. An important thing to check is the important_missing_information value, where MindsDB points to the important missing information that should be included to give a more accurate prediction. In this case, the Contract , MonthlyCharges , TotalCharges , and OnlineBackup columns are the important missing information. Let\u2019s include those values in the WHERE clause, and run a new query. SELECT Churn , Churn_confidence , Churn_explain FROM mindsdb . customer_churn_predictor WHERE SeniorCitizen = 0 AND Partner = 'Yes' AND Dependents = 'No' AND tenure = 1 AND PhoneService = 'No' AND MultipleLines = 'No phone service' AND InternetService = 'DSL' AND OnlineSecurity = 'No' AND OnlineBackup = 'Yes' AND DeviceProtection = 'No' AND TechSupport = 'No' AND StreamingTV = 'No' AND StreamingMovies = 'No' AND Contract = 'Month-to-month' AND PaperlessBilling = 'Yes' AND PaymentMethod = 'Electronic check' AND MonthlyCharges = 29 . 85 AND TotalCharges = 29 . 85 ; On execution, we get: + -------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Churn | Churn_confidence | Churn_explain | + -------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Yes | 0 . 8202247191011236 | { \"predicted_value\" : \"Yes\" , \"confidence\" : 0 . 8202247191011236 , \"anomaly\" : null , \"truth\" : null } | + -------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Here, MindsDB predicted the probability of this customer churning with the confidence of around 82%.

It is known as a silent killer, as recent studies have shown that by the year 2040 the world's diabetic patients will reach 642 million. The need to analyze vast medical data to assist in the diagnoses, treatment and management of illnesses is increasing for the medical community. With the rapid development of machine learning, it has been applied to many aspects of medical health and is transforming the healthcare system. The vitality to intelligently transform information into valuable knowledge through machine learning has become more present in biosciences. With the use of predictive models, MindsDB can assist in classifying diabetic and non-diabetic patients or those who pose a high risk. This is just a small showcase on how MindsDB's machine learning will be able to assist in vastly enhancing the reach of illnesses, thereby making it more efficient and can revolutionize businesses and most importantly the health care system. In this tutorial we will be exploring how we can use a machine learning model to classify negative and positive cases for diabetes. MindsDB allows you to train your model from CSV data directly, however for this tutorial you will: Establish a connection between your database and MindsDB via MindsDB GUI(Cloud and local instance). Allow connections to the database using Ngrok. Create a machine learning model using SQL. Make a prediction. Connect your database to MindsDB GUI \u00b6 MindsDB has a functionality to upload your dataset directly to MindsDB. However in this tutorial, you will be shown how to connect your database to MindsDB cloud and local instance. For this example we will be using a local postgres database, therefore we will connect using an ngrok tunnel. Running a Ngrok Tunnel \u00b6 To make our database publicly avaiable, we will use ngrok . The following command can be run in docker or a terminal on your device to set up a ngrok tunnel. ngrok tcp [ db-port ] For this example the port number used is 5432. You should see a similar output: Session Status online Account chandre (Plan: Free) Version 2.3.40 Region United States (us) Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040 Forwarding tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io:13096 -> localhost:5432 The information required is by the forwarded address, next to 'Forwarding' select and copy 4.tcp.ngrok.io:13096 . Once you have copied the information, you can add it to the information requested by the MindsDB GUI which we will get to in a moment.

Machine learning technology, a subfield of artificial intelligence, is enabling scientists, clinicians and patients to detect it in the earlier stages and therefore save lives. Until now, building, deploying and maintaining applied machine learning solutions was a complicated and expensive task, because it required skilled personnel and expensive tools. But not only that. A traditional machine learning project requires building integrations with data and applications, that is not only a technical but also an organizational challenge. So what if machine learning can become a part of the standard tools that are already in use? This is exactly the problem that MindsDB is solving. It makes machine learning easy to use by automating and integrating it into the mainstream instruments for data and analytics, namely databases and business intelligence software. It adds an AI \u201cbrain\u201d to databases so that they can learn automatically from existing data, allowing you to generate and visualize predictions using standard data query language like SQL. Lastly, MindsDB is open-source, and anyone can use it for free. In this article, we will show step by step how to use MindsDB inside databases to predict the risk of heart disease for patients. You can follow this tutorial by connecting to your own database and using different data - the same workflow applies to most machine learning use cases. Let\u2019s get started! Pre-requisites \u00b6 If you want to install MindsDB locally, check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi and you can follow this tutorial. If you are OK with using MindsDB cloud, then simply create a free account and you will be up and running in just one minute. Second, you will need to have a mysql client like DBeaver, MySQL Workbench etc. installed locally to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API. MindsDB contains a SQL Editor which can be accessed on MindsDB cloud or the URL 127.0.0.1:47334/. Data Overview \u00b6 For the example of this tutorial, we will use the heart disease dataset available publicly in Kaggle . Each row represents a patient and we will train a machine learning model to help us predict if the patient is classified as a heart disease patient. Below is a short description of each feature inside the data. age - In Years sex - 1 = Male; 0 = Female cp - chest pain type (4 values) trestbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) chol - Serum cholesterol in mg/dl fbs - Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved exang - Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment ca - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy thal - 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect target - 1 or 0 (This is what we will predict) How to use MindsDB \u00b6 MindsDB allows you to automatically create & train machine learning models from the data in your database that you have connected to in the previous step. MindsDB works via MySQL wire protocol, which means you can do all these steps through SQL commands. When it comes to making predictions, SQL queries become even handier, because you can easily make them straight from your existing applications or Business Intelligence tools that already speak SQL. The ML models are available to use immediately after being trained as if they were virtual database tables (a concept called \u201cAI Tables\u201d). So, let\u2019s see how it works. Connect to your data \u00b6 First, we need to connect MindsDB to the database where the Heart Disease data is stored: - Access MindsDB GUI on either cloud or local via the URL 127.0.0.1:47334/ - On the default page, select the button Add Data or alternatively select the plug icon on the left sidebar. - The 'Select your data source' page will populate for you to choose your database type. For this tutorial we will be selecting the postgres database button. Once you have selected the database type,the page will automatically navigate to the SQL Editor where the syntax to create a database connection will automatically populate for you to enter the required parameters. The required parameters are: CREATE DATABASE display_name --- display name for database. WITH ENGINE = \"postgres\", --- name of the mindsdb handler PARAMETERS = { \"user\": \" \", --- Your database user. \"password\": \" \", --- Your password. \"host\": \" \", --- host, it can be an ip or an url. \"port\": \"5432\", --- common port is 5432. \"database\": \" \" --- The name of your database *optional.} Select the Run button or Shift+Enter to execute the syntax. Once the Database connection is created the console will display a message 'Query successfully completed'. Create a machine learning model. \u00b6 We can create a machine learning predictive model by using simple SQL statements executed in the SQL Editor. To create and train a new machine learning model we will need to use the CREATE PREDICTOR statement: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) PREDICT column_name ; The required values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string): The name of the model integration_name (string): The name of the connection to your database. column_name (string): The feature you want to predict. To train the model that will predict the risk of heart disease as target we will run: CREATE PREDICTOR patients_target FROM mindsdb_predictions ( SELECT * FROM heart_disease ) PREDICT target ; Select the Run button or Shift+Enter to execute the syntax. Once the machine learning model is created the console will display a message 'Query successfully completed'. What we did here was to create a predictor called patients_target to predict the presence of heart disease as target . The model has started training. To check if the training has finished you can SELECT the model name from the predictors table: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'patients_target' ; The complete status means that the model training has successfully finished. Using SQL Statements to make predictions \u00b6 The next steps would be to query the model and predict the heart disease risk. Let\u2019s imagine a patient. This patient\u2019s age is 30, she has a cholesterol level of 177 mg/dl, with slope of the peak exercise ST segment as 2, and thal as 2. Add all of this information to the WHERE clause. SELECT target AS prediction , target_confidence AS confidence , target_explain AS info FROM mindsdb . patients_target WHERE age = 30 AND chol = 177 AND slope = 2 AND thal = 2 ; With a confidence of around 83%, MindsDB predicted a high risk of heart disease for this patient. The above example shows how you can make predictions for a single patient. But what if you have a table in your database with many patients\u2019 diagnosis data, and you want to make predictions for them in bulk? For this purpose, you can join the predictor with such a table. SELECT * FROM mindsdb_predictions . heart_disease AS t JOIN mindsdb . patients_target AS tb WHERE t . thal = 2 ; Now you can even connect the output table to your BI tool and for more convenient visualization of the results using graphs or pivots. Conclusion \u00b6 In this tutorial, you have seen how easy it is to apply machine learning for your predictive needs. MindsDB's innovative open-source technology is making it easy to leverage machine learning for people who are not experts in this field. However, MindsDB is a great tool for ML practitioners as well: if you are a skilled data scientist, you could also benefit from the convenience of deploying custom machine learning solutions within databases by building & configuring models manually through a declarative syntax called JSON-AI . There are other interesting ML use cases where MindsDB is positioned extremely well, like multivariate time-series and real-time data streams, so feel free to check it yourself .","title":"Heart Disease"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/heart-disease/#pre-requisites","text":"If you want to install MindsDB locally, check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi and you can follow this tutorial.

Let\u2019s imagine a patient. This patient\u2019s age is 30, she has a cholesterol level of 177 mg/dl, with slope of the peak exercise ST segment as 2, and thal as 2. Add all of this information to the WHERE clause.

The above example shows how you can make predictions for a single patient. But what if you have a table in your database with many patients\u2019 diagnosis data, and you want to make predictions for them in bulk? For this purpose, you can join the predictor with such a table.

MindsDB's innovative open-source technology is making it easy to leverage machine learning for people who are not experts in this field. However, MindsDB is a great tool for ML practitioners as well: if you are a skilled data scientist, you could also benefit from the convenience of deploying custom machine learning solutions within databases by building & configuring models manually through a declarative syntax called JSON-AI . There are other interesting ML use cases where MindsDB is positioned extremely well, like multivariate time-series and real-time data streams, so feel free to check it yourself .","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/home-rentals/","text":"Predicting Home Rental Prices with MindsDB \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 In this tutorial, we'll create, train, and query a machine learning model, which, in MindsDB language, is an AI Table or a predictor . We aim to predict the rental_price value for new properties based on their attributes, such as the number of rooms, area, or neighborhood. Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation either locally or via cloud.mindsdb.com . You can learn how to set up your account at MindsDB Cloud by following this guide . Another way is to set up MindsDB locally using Docker or Python . Let's get started. The Data \u00b6 Connecting the data \u00b6 There are a couple of ways you can get the data to follow through with this tutorial. Connecting as a database via CREATE DATABASE Connecting as a file You can connect to a demo database that we've prepared for you. It contains the data used throughout this tutorial which is the example_db . demo_data . home_rentals table. CREATE DATABASE example_db WITH ENGINE = \"postgres\" , PARAMETERS = { \"user\" : \"demo_user\" , \"password\" : \"demo_password\" , \"host\" : \"3.220.66.106\" , \"port\" : \"5432\" , \"database\" : \"demo\" } ; Now you can run queries directly on the demo database. Let's preview the data that we'll use to train our predictor. SELECT * FROM example_db . demo_data . home_rentals LIMIT 10 ; You can download the source file as a .CSV here and then upload it via MindsDB SQL Editor . Follow this guide to find out how to upload a file to MindsDB. Now you can run queries directly on the file as if it were a table. Let's preview the data that we'll use to train our predictor. SELECT * FROM files . home_rentals LIMIT 10 ; From now on, we will use the example_db . demo_data . home_rentals table. Make sure you replace it with files.home_rentals if you connect the data as a file. Understanding the Data \u00b6 We will use the home rentals dataset where each row represents one rental home. We will predict the rental price value for all the newly added properties in the following sections of this tutorial. Below is the sample data stored in the example_db . demo_data . home_rentals table. + -----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+----------------+--------------+ | number_of_rooms | number_of_bathrooms | sqft | location | days_on_market | neighborhood | rental_price | + -----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+----------------+--------------+ | 2 | 1 | 917 | great | 13 | berkeley_hills | 3901 | | 0 | 1 | 194 | great | 10 | berkeley_hills | 2042 | | 1 | 1 | 543 | poor | 18 | westbrae | 1871 | | 2 | 1 | 503 | good | 10 | downtown | 3026 | | 3 | 2 | 1066 | good | 13 | thowsand_oaks | 4774 | + -----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+----------------+--------------+ Where: Column Description Data Type Usage number_of_rooms Number of rooms in a given house [0,1,2,3] integer Feature number_of_bathrooms Number of bathrooms in a given house [1,2] integer Feature sqft Area of a given house in square feet integer Feature location Rating of the location of a given house [poor, great, good] character varying Feature days_on_market Number of days a given house has been open to be rented integer Feature neighborhood Neighborhood a given house is in [alcatraz_ave, westbrae, ..., south_side, thowsand_oaks ] character varying Feature rental_price Rental price of a given house in dollars integer Label Labels and Features A label is the thing we're predicting \u2014 the y variable in simple linear regression. A feature is an input variable \u2014 the x variable in simple linear regression. Training a Predictor Via CREATE PREDICTOR \u00b6 Let's create and train your first machine learning predictor. For that, we are going to use the CREATE PREDICTOR syntax where we specify what sub-query to train FROM (features) and what we want to PREDICT (labels). CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . home_rentals_predictor FROM example_db ( SELECT * FROM demo_data . home_rentals ) PREDICT rental_price ; We use all of the columns as features, except for the rental_price column whose value is going to be predicted. Checking the Status of a Predictor \u00b6 A predictor may take a couple of minutes for the training to complete. You can monitor the status of your predictor by using this SQL command: SELECT status FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'home_rentals_predictor' ; If we run it right after creating a predictor, we'll most probably get this output: + ----------+ | status | + ----------+ | training | + ----------+ But if we wait a couple of minutes, this should be the output: + ----------+ | status | + ----------+ | complete | + ----------+ Now, if the status of our predictor says complete , we can start making predictions! Making Predictions \u00b6 Making Predictions Via SELECT \u00b6 You can make predictions by querying the predictor as if it were a table. The SELECT syntax lets you make predictions for the label based on the chosen features. SELECT rental_price , rental_price_explain FROM mindsdb . home_rentals_model WHERE sqft = 823 AND location = 'good' AND neighborhood = 'downtown' AND days_on_market = 10 ; On execution, we get: + --------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | rental_price | rental_price_explain | + --------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 4394 | { \"predicted_value\" : 4394 , \"confidence\" : 0 . 99 , \"anomaly\" : null , \"truth\" : null , \"confidence_lower_bound\" : 4313 , \"confidence_upper_bound\" : 4475 } | + --------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Making Batch Predictions Via JOIN \u00b6 Also, you can make bulk predictions by joining a table with your predictor. SELECT t . rental_price AS real_price , m . rental_price AS predicted_price , t . number_of_rooms , t . number_of_bathrooms , t . sqft , t . location , t . days_on_market FROM example_db . demo_data . home_rentals AS t JOIN mindsdb . home_rentals_model AS m LIMIT 100 ; On execution, we get: + ------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+ | real_price | predicted_price | number_of_rooms | number_of_bathrooms | sqft | location | days_on_market | + ------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+ | 3901 | 3886 | 2 | 1 | 917 | great | 13 | | 2042 | 2007 | 0 | 1 | 194 | great | 10 | | 1871 | 1865 | 1 | 1 | 543 | poor | 18 | | 3026 | 3020 | 2 | 1 | 503 | good | 10 | | 4774 | 4748 | 3 | 2 | 1066 | good | 13 | + ------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+ What's Next? \u00b6 Have fun while trying it out yourself!

So please make sure you've visited Getting Started Guide and Getting Started with Cloud . You may start to use MindsDB by installing it locally or you can use the Cloud service. Let\u2019s use the cloud for this tutorial. Second, you need a MySQL client to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API. Can you accurately predict insurance costs? \u00b6 In this tutorial, you will learn how to predict insurance costs using MindsDB. This tutorial is very easy because you don't need to learn any machine learning algorithms, all you need to know is just SQL. The process looks like the following: First we will connect MindsDB to a database with past data so it can learn from it We will use a single SQL command that will tell MindsDB to train its predictor We will use the standard SQL Select statement to get predictions from AI Tables in MindsDB. Like if this data already exists! MindsDB will execute a complete Machine Learning workflow behind the scenes, it will determine data types for each column, normalize and encode it, train and test ML model. All this happens automatically, so it is very cool! Those who want to get their hands dirty with manual hyperparameters optimization, you can also do that with MindsDB using a declarative syntax called JSON-AI. So let's look at how it works using a real use case. For the demo purpose we will use a public dataset from Kaggle, but you are free to follow this tutorial with your own data. Connect your database \u00b6 First, you need to connect MindsDB to the database where the data is stored. Open MindsDB GUI and in the left navigation click on Database, then click on the ADD DATABASE. Here, you need to provide all of the required parameters for connecting to the database. Supported Database - select the database that you want to connect to Integrations Name - add a name to the integration, here I'm using 'mysql' but you can name it differently Database - the database name Host - database hostname Port - database port Username - database user Password - user's password Then, click on CONNECT. The next step is to use the MySQL client to connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API, train a new model, and make a prediction. Connect to MindsDB\u2019s MySQL API \u00b6 Here I'm using MySQL command-line client, but you can also follow up with the one that works the best for you, like Dbeaver. The first step is to use the MindsDB Cloud user to connect to the MindsDB MySQL API, using this command: You need to specify the hostname and user name explicitly, as well as a password for connecting. Click enter and you are connected to MindsDB API. If you have an authentication error, please make sure you are providing the email address you have used to create an account on MindsDB Cloud. Data \u00b6 Now, let's show the databases. There are 4 databases, and the MySQL database is the database that I've connected to MindsDB. Let's check the MySQL database. There are 3 tables, and because the tutorial is about insurance cost prediction, we will use the insurance table. Let's check what is inside this table. So, these tables have 7 columns: age: The age of the person (integer) sex: Gender (male or female) bmi: Body mass index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m\u00b2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters (float) children: The number of children (integer) smoker: Indicator if the person smoke (yes or no) region: Region where the insured lives (southeast, northeast, southwest or northwest) charges: The insurance cost, this is the target of prediction (float) Create the model \u00b6 Now, to create the model, let's move to the MindsDB database, and see what's inside. There are 2 tables, predictors, and commands. Predictors contain your predictors record, and commands contain your last commands used. To train a new machine learning model we will need to CREATE PREDICTOR as a new record inside the predictors table, and using this command: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) AS ds_name PREDICT column_name AS column_alias ; The values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. integration_name (string) - The name of the connection to your database. ds_name (string) - the name of the dataset you want to create, it's optional if you don't specify this value MindsDB will generate by itself. column_name (string) - The feature you want to predict. column_alias - Alias name of the feature you want to predict. So, use this command to create the models: CREATE PREDICTOR insurance_cost_predictor FROM insurance_costs ( SELECT * FROM insurance ) PREDICT charges ; If there's no error, that means your model is created and training has started. To see if your model is finished, use this command: SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = predictor_name ; And values that we need to provide are: predictor_name (string) - The name of the model. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'insurance_cost_predictor' ; If the predictor is ready, it will look like this. The model has been created and trained! The reported accuracy is 75%. If you want to have more control over the model, head to lightwood.io to see how that can be customized. Make prediction \u00b6 Now you are in the last step of this tutorial, making the prediction. To make a prediction you can use this command: SELECT target_variable , target_variable_explain FROM model_table WHERE column3 = \"value\" AND column2 = value ; You need to set these values: target_variable - The original value of the target variable. target_variable_confidence - Model confidence score. target_variable_explain - JSON object that contains additional information as confidence_lower_bound, confidence_upper_bound, anomaly, truth. when_data - The data to make the predictions from(WHERE clause params). SELECT charges , charges_confidence , charges_explain AS info FROM insurance_cost_predictor WHERE age = 20 AND sex = 'male' AND bmi = 33 . 20 AND children = 0 AND smoker = 'no' AND region = 'southeast' ; Finally, we have trained an insurance model using SQL and MindsDB. Conclusions \u00b6 As you can see it is very easy to start making predictions with machine learning even without being a data scientist! Feel free to check this yourself, MindsDB has an option of a free cloud account that is more than enough to give it a try.","title":"Insurance Cost"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/insurance-cost-prediction/#predict-insurance-cost-using-mindsdb","text":"Dataset: Medical Cost Personal Data Communtiy Author: Kinie K Kusuma","title":"Predict Insurance Cost using MindsDB"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/insurance-cost-prediction/#pre-requisites","text":"First, you need MindsDB installed.

(if you are not familiar with AI-Tables, you can learn about them in here . Imagine that you are a data analyst at the Chicago Transit Authority. Every day, you need to optimize the number of buses per route to avoid overcrowded or empty buses. You need machine learning to forecast the number of rides per bus, per route, and by time of day. The data you have looks like the table below with route_id, timestamp, number of rides, and day-type (W = weekend) This is a difficult machine learning problem that is common in databases. A timestamp indicates that we are dealing with the time-series problem. The data is further complicated by the type of day (day-type) the row contains and this is called multivariate. Additionally, there is high-cardinality as each route will have multiple row entries each with different timestamps, rides, and day types. Let\u2019s see how we can use machine learning with MindsDB to optimize the number of buses per route and visualize the results. Set Up MindsDB \u00b6 First things first! You need to connect your database to MindsDB. One of the easy ways to do so is to create a MindsDB cloud account. If you prefer to deploy MindsDB locally, please refer to installation instructions via Docker or PyPI . Once an account is created you can connect to Snowflake using standard parameters like database name (in this case the Chicago Transit Authority), host, port, username, password, etc. Connect MindsDB to the Data for model training \u00b6 MindsDB works through a MySQL Wire protocol. Therefore, you can connect to it using any MySQL client. Here, we\u2019ll use the DBeaver database client and can see the Snowflake databases we are connected to. Step 1: Getting the Training Data \u00b6 We start by getting the training data from the database that we connected to our MindsDB cloud account. It is always good to first make sure that all the databases are present and the connections correct. show databases ; MindsDB comes with some built-in databases as follows: INFORMATION_SCHEMA stores information about MindsDB, MINDSDB stores metadata about the predictors and allows access to the created predictors as tables, DATASOURCE for connecting to data or uploading files. The SNF database is the database of the Chicago Transit Authority that we connected. It provides us with the training data. Let\u2019s check it. SELECT * FROM CHICAGO_TRANSIT_AUTHORITY . PUBLIC . CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST LIMIT 100 ; The training data consists of the number of rides per bus route and day. For example, on 2001-07-03, there were 7354 rides on bus route 3. You can download the dataset here and execute the SQL commands along with the tutorial! Step 2: Training the Predictive Model \u00b6 Let\u2019s move on to the next step, which is training the predictive model. For that, we\u2019ll use the MINDSDB database. use mindsdb ; show tables MINDSDB database comes with the predictors and commands tables. The predictors table lets us see the status of our predictive models. For example, assuming that we have already trained our predictive model for forecasting the number of rides, we\u2019ll see the following. SELECT name , status FROM MINDSDB . PREDICTORS ; The process of training a predictive model using MindsDB is as simple as creating a view or a table. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . rides_forecaster_demo FROM snf ( SELECT ROUTE , RIDES , DATE FROM CHICAGO_TRANSIT_AUTHORITY . PUBLIC . CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST WHERE DATE > '2020-01-01' ) PREDICT RIDES ORDER BY DATE GROUP BY ROUTE WINDOW 10 HORIZON 7 ; Let\u2019s discuss the statement above. We create a predictor table using the CREATE PREDICTOR statement and specifying the database from which the training data comes. The code in yellow selects the filtered training data. After that, we use the PREDICT keyword to define the column whose data we want to forecast. Next, there are standard SQL clauses, such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, WINDOW, and HORIZON . We use the ORDER BY clause and the DATE column as its argument. By doing so, we emphasize that we deal with a time-series problem. We order the rows by date. The GROUP BY clause divides the data into partitions. Here, each of them relates to a particular bus route. We take into account just the last ten rows for every given prediction. Hence, we use WINDOW 10. To prepare the forecast of the number of bus rides for the next week, we define HORIZON 7. Now, you can execute the CREATE PREDICTOR statement and wait until your predictive model is complete. The MINDSDB.PREDICTORS table stores its name as rides_forecaster_demo and its status as training. Once your predictive model is ready, the status changes to complete. Step 3: Getting the Forecasts \u00b6 We are ready to go to the last step, i.e., using the predictive model to get future data. One way is to query the rides_forecaster_demo predictive model directly. Another way is to join this predictive model table to the table with historical data before querying it. We consider a time-series problem. Therefore, it is better to join our predictive model table to the table with historical data. SELECT tb . ROUTE , tb . RIDES AS PREDICTED_RIDES FROM snf . PUBLIC . CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST AS ta JOIN mindsdb . rides_forecaster_demo AS tb WHERE ta . ROUTE = \"171\" AND ta . DATE > LATEST LIMIT 7 ; Let\u2019s analyze it. We join the table that stores historical data (i.e., snf.PUBLIC.CTA_BUS_RIDES_LATEST) to our predictive model table (i.e., mindsdb.rides_forecaster_demo). The queried information is the route and the predicted number of rides per route. And the usage of the condition ta.DATE > LATEST (provided by MindsDB) ensures that we get the future number of rides per route. Let\u2019s run the query above to forecast the number of rides for route 171 in the next seven days. Now we know the number of rides for route 171 in the next seven days. We could do it in the same way for all the other routes. Thanks to the special SQL syntax that includes CREATE PREDICTOR, PREDICT, and > LATEST, MindsDB makes it straightforward to run predictors on our chosen data. Now, let\u2019s visualize our predictions. Visualizing the Results using Apache Superset \u00b6 Apache Superset is a modern, open-source data exploration and visualization platform designed for all data personas in an organization. Superset ships with a powerful SQL editor and a no-code chart builder experience. Superset ships with support for most SQL databases out of the box and over 50 visualization types. You can connect to the Snowflake database or your MindsDB database that has a Snowflake connection within. Upon starting up your Superset workspace, your earlier defined database connection is ready to use! So you have access to the Chicago Transit Authority data, as well as to the predictions made by MindsDB. Visualizing Data \u00b6 The two data sets that we are relevant for visualization are the stops_by_route and forecasts data sets. The stops_by_route data set contains the exact location of each bus stop for each bus route. And the forecasts data set stores the actual and predicted number of rides, confidence interval, and lower and upper bounds of prediction, per route and timestamp. Superset lets us visualize the stops_by_route data set as follows. Every bus route has a different color. Also, there is volatility associated with each bus route. Let\u2019s publish this chart to a new dashboard by clicking the +Save button, then switch to the Save as tab, and then type in \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d in the Add to Dashboard field. Now, let\u2019s craft a time-series line chart to visualize actual vs predicted riders. Let\u2019s look at the chart that presents the actual number of bus riders (in blue) and the predicted number of bus rides (in purple). Predictions made by MindsDB closely resemble the actual data, except for a short time during March 2020 when the large-scale lockdowns took place. There we see a sudden drop in the number of bus rides. But MindsDB took some time to cope with this new reality and adjust its predictions. Lastly, let\u2019s add a data zoom to this chart for end-users to zoom in on specific date ranges. Click the Customize tab and then click Data Zoom to enable it. Then, click the + Save button and publish to the same \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d. Let\u2019s head over to the dashboard now and customize it to make it more dynamic and explorable. Click Dashboards in the top nav bar and then select \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d from the list of dashboards. You can rearrange the chart positions by clicking the pencil icon, dragging the corners of the chart objects, and then clicking Save . Let\u2019s add some dashboard filters to this dashboard so dashboard consumers can filter the charts down to specific bus routes and volatility values. Click the right arrow (->) to pop open the filter tray. Then select the pencil icon to start editing this dashboard\u2019s filters. Create the following filters with appropriate filter names: A Value filter on the route column from the forecasts table. A Numerical range filter on the volatility column from the stops_by_route table. Click Save to publish these filters. Let\u2019s give these filters for a test ride! Use the routes filter to only show information for routes 1, 100, and 1001. We could zoom in to see the time during the first large-scale lockdowns in March 2020. For these particular routes, the predictions made by MindsDB are not so far off. Now, let\u2019s use our volatility filter to view only the routes with volatility values greater than 55. Conclusions: Powerful forecasting with MindsDB, your database, and Superset \u00b6 The combination of MindsDB and your database covers all the phases of the ML lifecycle. And Superset helps you to visualize the data in any form of diagrams, charts, or dashboards. MindsDB provides easy-to-use predictive models through AI Tables. You can create these predictive models using SQL statements and feeding the input data. Also, you can query them the same way you query a table. The easiest way to get started with Superset is with the free tier for Preset Cloud , a hassle-free and fully hosted cloud service for Superset. We encourage you to try some predictions with your own data, so please sign up for a free MindsDB cloud account and if you need any help with MindsDB, feel free to ask our Slack and Github communities.

The stops_by_route data set contains the exact location of each bus stop for each bus route. And the forecasts data set stores the actual and predicted number of rides, confidence interval, and lower and upper bounds of prediction, per route and timestamp. Superset lets us visualize the stops_by_route data set as follows. Every bus route has a different color. Also, there is volatility associated with each bus route. Let\u2019s publish this chart to a new dashboard by clicking the +Save button, then switch to the Save as tab, and then type in \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d in the Add to Dashboard field. Now, let\u2019s craft a time-series line chart to visualize actual vs predicted riders. Let\u2019s look at the chart that presents the actual number of bus riders (in blue) and the predicted number of bus rides (in purple). Predictions made by MindsDB closely resemble the actual data, except for a short time during March 2020 when the large-scale lockdowns took place. There we see a sudden drop in the number of bus rides. But MindsDB took some time to cope with this new reality and adjust its predictions. Lastly, let\u2019s add a data zoom to this chart for end-users to zoom in on specific date ranges. Click the Customize tab and then click Data Zoom to enable it. Then, click the + Save button and publish to the same \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d. Let\u2019s head over to the dashboard now and customize it to make it more dynamic and explorable. Click Dashboards in the top nav bar and then select \u201cRoutes Dashboard\u201d from the list of dashboards. You can rearrange the chart positions by clicking the pencil icon, dragging the corners of the chart objects, and then clicking Save . Let\u2019s add some dashboard filters to this dashboard so dashboard consumers can filter the charts down to specific bus routes and volatility values. Click the right arrow (->) to pop open the filter tray. Then select the pencil icon to start editing this dashboard\u2019s filters. Create the following filters with appropriate filter names: A Value filter on the route column from the forecasts table. A Numerical range filter on the volatility column from the stops_by_route table. Click Save to publish these filters. Let\u2019s give these filters for a test ride! Use the routes filter to only show information for routes 1, 100, and 1001. We could zoom in to see the time during the first large-scale lockdowns in March 2020. For these particular routes, the predictions made by MindsDB are not so far off. Now, let\u2019s use our volatility filter to view only the routes with volatility values greater than 55.","title":"Visualizing Data"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/mindsdb-superset-snowflake/#conclusions-powerful-forecasting-with-mindsdb-your-database-and-superset","text":"The combination of MindsDB and your database covers all the phases of the ML lifecycle.

Its usage dates back centuries with ancient Greek, Chinese and African cultures. They can have high nutritional value and medicinal properties which provide great health benefits. On the other side,some of these fungi can be toxic and consuming the wrong mushroom can have deadly consequences. It is important for industries across the world, like the food and health sector, to identify which type of mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous. We will explore how MindsDB's machine learning predictive model can make it easier classifying mushrooms and predicting which is safe to consume and which can make you ill. Pre-requisites \u00b6 To ensure you can complete all the steps, make sure you have access to the following tools: A MindsDB instance. Check out the installation guide for Docker or PyPi . You can also use MindsDB Cloud . Downloaded the dataset. You can get it from Kaggle Optional: Access to ngrok. You can check the installation details at the ngrok website . Data Overview \u00b6 The dataset consists of the following information: Attribute Information: (classes: edible=e, poisonous=p) - cap_shape: bell=b,conical=c,convex=x,flat=f, knobbed=k,sunken=s - cap_surface: fibrous=f,grooves=g,scaly=y,smooth=s - cap_color: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,green=r,pink=p,purple=u,red=e,white=w,yellow=y - bruises: bruises=t,no=f - odor: almond=a,anise=l,creosote=c,fishy=y,foul=f,musty=m,none=n,pungent=p,spicy=s - gill_attachment: attached=a,descending=d,free=f,notched=n - gill_spacing: close=c,crowded=w,distant=d - gill_size: broad=b,narrow=n - gill_color: black=k,brown=n,buff=b,chocolate=h,gray=g, green=r,orange=o,pink=p,purple=u,red=e,white=w,yellow=y - stalk_shape: enlarging=e,tapering=t - stalk_root: bulbous=b,club=c,cup=u,equal=e,rhizomorphs=z,rooted=r,missing=? - stalk_surface_above_ring: fibrous=f,scaly=y,silky=k,smooth=s - stalk_surface_below_ring: fibrous=f,scaly=y,silky=k,smooth=s - stalk_color_above_ring: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,orange=o,pink=p,red=e,white=w,yellow=y - stalk_color_below_ring: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,orange=o,pink=p,red=e,white=w,yellow=y - veil_type: partial=p,universal=u - veil_color: brown=n,orange=o,white=w,yellow=y - ring_number: none=n,one=o,two=t - ring_type: cobwebby=c,evanescent=e,flaring=f,large=l,none=n,pendant=p,sheathing=s,zone=z - spore_print_color: black=k,brown=n,buff=b,chocolate=h,green=r,orange=o,purple=u,white=w,yellow=y - population: abundant=a,clustered=c,numerous=n,scattered=s,several=v,solitary=y - habitat: grasses=g,leaves=l,meadows=m,paths=p,urban=u,waste=w,woods=d Database connection to MindsDB \u00b6 To establish a database connection we will access MindsDB's GUI. MindsDB has a SQL Editor on Cloud and local via the URL 127.0.0.1:47334/. First, we need to connect MindsDB to the database where the Mushrooms data is stored: Access MindsDB GUI on either cloud or the URL 127.0.0.1:47334/ On the default page, select the button Add Data or alternatively select the plug icon on the left sidebar The 'Select your data source' page will populate for you to choose your database type. For this tutorial we will be selecting the postgres database button. Once you have selected the database type,the page will automatically navigate to the SQL Editor where the syntax to create a database connection will automatically populate for you to enter the required parameters. The required parameters are: CREATE DATABASE display_name --- display name for database. WITH ENGINE = \"postgres\", --- name of the mindsdb handler PARAMETERS = { \"user\": \" \", --- Your database user. \"password\": \" \", --- Your password. \"host\": \" \", --- host, it can be an ip or an url. \"port\": \"5432\", --- common port is 5432. \"database\": \" \" --- The name of your database *optional. } Select the Run button or Shift+Enter to execute the syntax. Once the Database connection is created the console will display a message 'Query successfully completed'. \u200b Please note that some database connections require running a Ngrok tunnel to establish a connection. Run the ngrok command in a terminal: ngrok tcp [ db-port ] for example,if your port number is 5433 you will see a similar output: Session Status online Account myaccount (Plan: Free) Version 2.3.40 Region United States (us) Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040 Forwarding tcp://6.tcp.ngrok.io:14789 -> localhost:5433 The forwarded address information will be required when connecting to MindsDB's GUI. Select and copy the 'Forwarding' information, in this case it is 6.tcp.ngrok.io:14789 , where 6.tcp.ngrok.io will be used for the host parameter and 14789 as the port number. Once the database integration is successful we can query the table from the database to ensure the data pulls through on MindsDB. Create a machine learning model. \u00b6 Now we are ready to create our own predictor. We will start by using the SQL Editor to execute simple SQL syntax to create and train a machine learning predictive model. The predictor we will and be trained to determine if a mushroom is edible or poisonous.The following CREATE PREDICTOR statement is used to create predictors: CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . predictor_name FROM integration_name ( SELECT column_name , column_name2 FROM table_name ) PREDICT column_name ; The required values that we need to provide are: \u200b - predictor_name (string): The name of the model - integration_name (string): The name of the connection to your database. - column_name (string): The feature you want to predict. Use the following query to create a predictor that will predict the target_class for the specific field parameters. CREATE PREDICTOR mushroom_predictor FROM mindsdb_predictions ( SELECT * FROM mushrooms ) PREDICT class ; Select the Run button or Shift+Enter to execute the syntax. Once the predictor is created the console will display a message 'Query successfully completed'. The predictor was created successfully and has started training. To check the status of the model, use the below query. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'mushroom_predictor' ; After the predictor has finished training, you will see a similar output. Note that MindsDB does model testing for you automatically, so you will immediately see if the predictor is accurate enough. The predictor has completed its training, indicated by the status column, and shows the accuracy of the model. You can revisit training new predictors to increase accuracy by changing the query to better suit the dataset i.e. omitting certain columns etc. Good job! We have successfully created and trained a predictive model \u2728 Make predictions \u00b6 In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model. Now we will use the trained model to make predictions using a SQL syntax. Use the following query using mock data with the predictor. SELECT class FROM mindsdb . mushroom_predictor WHERE cap_shape = 'x' AND cap_surface = 's' AND cap_color = 'n' AND bruises = 't' AND odor = 'p' AND gill_attachment = 'f' AND gill_spacing = 'c' AND gill_size = 'n' AND gill_color = 'k' AND stalk_shape = 'e' AND stalk_root = 'e' AND stalk_surface_above_ring = 's' AND stalk_surface_below_ring = 's' AND stalk_color_above_ring = 'w' AND stalk_color_below_ring = 'w' AND veil_type = 'p' AND veil_color = 'w' AND ring_number = 'o' AND ring_type = 'p' AND spore_print_color = 'k' AND population = 's' AND habitat = 'u' ; The result: The machine learning model has predicted that the mushroom is poisonous.

Manufacturing plants commonly use quality predictions to gain a competitive edge over their competitors, improve their products or increase their customers satisfaction. MindsDB is a tool that can help you solve quality prediction tasks easily and effectively using machine learning. MindsDB abstracts ML models as virtual \u201cAI Tables\u201d in databases and you can make predictions just using normal SQL commands.

If you are using MindsDB Cloud, make sure to add the file to a database and create a database connection to MindsDB's GUI. Cloud has a file size limit of 10MB, therefore for this dataset it would be best to either use MindsDB local instance or if on Cloud connect via a database. Select the Add data button or the plug icon on the left side bar. The page will navigate to the 'Select your data source' page. Select 'Files'. Under 'Import a file' select the tab 'Click here to browse local files' and select your data file. Once the file is uploaded 100%, provide a name for the data file that will be saved as a table. Select the button Save and Continue. You can query the file that has been uploaded to see that the data does pull through.

However you can also do this via the mysql client in a local terminal by accessing MindsDB SQL Server. mysql - h cloud . mindsdb . com --port 3306 -u username@email.com -p USE mindsdb ; Create a predictor \u00b6 In this section you will connect to MindsDB with the MySql API and create a Predictor. It is in MindsDB terms a machine learning model, but all its complexity is automated and abstracted as a virtual \u201cAI Table\u201d. If you are an ML expert and want to tweak the model, MindsDB also allows you that (please refer to documentation). Use the following query to create a Predictor that will foretell the silica_concentrate at the end of our mining process. The row number is limited to 5000 to speed up training but you can keep the whole dataset. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . process_quality_predictor FROM files ( SELECT iron_feed , silica_feed , starch_flow , amina_flow , ore_pulp_flow , ore_pulp_ph , ore_pulp_density , flotation_column_01_air_flow , flotation_column_02_air_flow , flotation_column_03_air_flow , flotation_column_04_air_flow , flotation_column_05_air_flow , flotation_column_06_air_flow , flotation_column_07_air_flow , flotation_column_01_level , flotation_column_02_level , flotation_column_03_level , flotation_column_04_level , flotation_column_05_level , flotation_column_06_level , flotation_column_07_level , iron_concentrate , silica_concentrate FROM process_quality LIMIT 5000 ) PREDICT silica_concentrate AS quality ; On execution, we get: Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 2 min 27 . 52 sec ) Now the Predictor will begin training. You can check the status with the following query. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'process_quality_predictor' ; On execution, we get: + -----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | select_data_query | training_options | + -----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | process_quality_predictor | complete | 1 | silica_concentrate | | | + -----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 28 sec ) As you can see the accuracy of the model is 1 (i.e. 100%). This is the result of using a limited dataset of 5000 rows. In reality when using the whole dataset, you will probably see a more reasonable accuracy. You are now done with creating the predictor! \u2728 Make predictions \u00b6 In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model. To run a prediction against new or existing data, you can use the following query. SELECT silica_concentrate , silica_concentrate_confidence , silica_concentrate_explain FROM mindsdb . process_quality_predictor WHERE iron_feed = 48 . 81 AND silica_feed = 25 . 31 AND starch_flow = 2504 . 94 AND amina_flow = 309 . 448 AND ore_pulp_flow = 377 . 6511682692 AND ore_pulp_ph = 10 . 0607 AND ore_pulp_density = 1 . 68676 ; On execution, we get: + --------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | silica_concentrate | silica_concentrate_confidence | Info | + --------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 . 68 | 0 . 99 | { \"predicted_value\" : \"1.68\" , \"confidence\" : 0 . 99 , \"confidence_lower_bound\" : null , \"confidence_upper_bound\" : null , \"anomaly\" : null , \"truth\" : null } | + --------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 81 sec ) As you can see, the model predicted the silica concentrate for our data point. Again we can see a very high confidence due to the limited dataset. When making predictions you can include different fields. As you can notice, we have only included the first 7 fields of our dataset. You are free to test different combinations. In the previous example, we have made a prediction for a single data point. In a real scenario, you might want to make predictions on multiple data points. In this case, MindsDB allows you to Join this other table with the Predictor. In result, you will get another table as an output with a predicted value as one of its columns. Let\u2019s see how to make batch predictions. Use the following command to create the batch prediction. SELECT collected_data . iron_feed , collected_data . silica_feed , collected_data . starch_flow , collected_data . amina_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_ph , collected_data . ore_pulp_density , predictions . silica_concentrate_confidence AS confidence , predictions . silica_concentrate AS predicted_silica_concentrate FROM process_quality_integration . process_quality AS collected_data JOIN mindsdb . process_quality_predictor AS predictions LIMIT 5 ; As you can see below, the predictor has made multiple predictions for each data point in the collected_data table! You can also try selecting other fields to get more insight on the predictions. See the JOIN clause documentation for more information. + -----------+-------------+-------------+------------+---------------+-------------+------------------+------------+------------------------------+ | iron_feed | silica_feed | starch_flow | amina_flow | ore_pulp_flow | ore_pulp_ph | ore_pulp_density | confidence | predicted_silica_concentrate | + -----------+-------------+-------------+------------+---------------+-------------+------------------+------------+------------------------------+ | 58 . 84 | 11 . 46 | 3277 . 34 | 564 . 209 | 403 . 242 | 9 . 88472 | 1 . 76297 | 0 . 99 | 2 . 129567174379606 | | 58 . 84 | 11 . 46 | 3333 . 59 | 565 . 308 | 401 . 016 | 9 . 88543 | 1 . 76331 | 0 . 99 | 2 . 129548423407259 | | 58 . 84 | 11 . 46 | 3400 . 39 | 565 . 674 | 399 . 551 | 9 . 88613 | 1 . 76366 | 0 . 99 | 2 . 130100408285386 | | 58 . 84 | 11 . 46 | 3410 . 55 | 563 . 843 | 397 . 559 | 9 . 88684 | 1 . 764 | 0 . 99 | 2 . 1298757513510136 | | 58 . 84 | 11 . 46 | 3408 . 98 | 559 . 57 | 401 . 719 | 9 . 88755 | 1 . 76434 | 0 . 99 | 2 . 130438907683961 | + -----------+-------------+-------------+------------+---------------+-------------+------------------+------------+------------------------------+ What's Next? \u00b6 Have fun while trying it out yourself!

MindsDB abstracts ML models as virtual \u201cAI Tables\u201d in databases and you can make predictions just using normal SQL commands. In this tutorial you will learn how to predict the quality of a mining process using MindsDB .","title":"Manufacturing process quality"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/process-quality/#upload-a-file","text":"Fix headers: sed -e 's/ /_/g' -e 's/\\(.*\\)/\\L\\1/' -e 's/%_//g' MiningProcess_Flotation_Plant_Database.csv > fixed_headers.csv (for Linux/Unix) edit headers manually: change space to underscore , upper case to lower case, remove % from headers (for Windows) Access MindsDB GUI on local via URL 127.0.0.1:47334/. If you are using MindsDB Cloud, make sure to add the file to a database and create a database connection to MindsDB's GUI. Cloud has a file size limit of 10MB, therefore for this dataset it would be best to either use MindsDB local instance or if on Cloud connect via a database. Select the Add data button or the plug icon on the left side bar. The page will navigate to the 'Select your data source' page. Select 'Files'. Under 'Import a file' select the tab 'Click here to browse local files' and select your data file. Once the file is uploaded 100%, provide a name for the data file that will be saved as a table.

It is in MindsDB terms a machine learning model, but all its complexity is automated and abstracted as a virtual \u201cAI Table\u201d. If you are an ML expert and want to tweak the model, MindsDB also allows you that (please refer to documentation). Use the following query to create a Predictor that will foretell the silica_concentrate at the end of our mining process. The row number is limited to 5000 to speed up training but you can keep the whole dataset. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . process_quality_predictor FROM files ( SELECT iron_feed , silica_feed , starch_flow , amina_flow , ore_pulp_flow , ore_pulp_ph , ore_pulp_density , flotation_column_01_air_flow , flotation_column_02_air_flow , flotation_column_03_air_flow , flotation_column_04_air_flow , flotation_column_05_air_flow , flotation_column_06_air_flow , flotation_column_07_air_flow , flotation_column_01_level , flotation_column_02_level , flotation_column_03_level , flotation_column_04_level , flotation_column_05_level , flotation_column_06_level , flotation_column_07_level , iron_concentrate , silica_concentrate FROM process_quality LIMIT 5000 ) PREDICT silica_concentrate AS quality ; On execution, we get: Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 2 min 27 . 52 sec ) Now the Predictor will begin training. You can check the status with the following query. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'process_quality_predictor' ; On execution, we get: + -----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | name | status | accuracy | predict | select_data_query | training_options | + -----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | process_quality_predictor | complete | 1 | silica_concentrate | | | + -----------------------------+----------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 28 sec ) As you can see the accuracy of the model is 1 (i.e. 100%). This is the result of using a limited dataset of 5000 rows. In reality when using the whole dataset, you will probably see a more reasonable accuracy. You are now done with creating the predictor! \u2728","title":"Create a predictor"},{"location":"sql/tutorials/process-quality/#make-predictions","text":"In this section you will learn how to make predictions using your trained model. To run a prediction against new or existing data, you can use the following query. SELECT silica_concentrate , silica_concentrate_confidence , silica_concentrate_explain FROM mindsdb . process_quality_predictor WHERE iron_feed = 48 . 81 AND silica_feed = 25 . 31 AND starch_flow = 2504 . 94 AND amina_flow = 309 . 448 AND ore_pulp_flow = 377 . 6511682692 AND ore_pulp_ph = 10 . 0607 AND ore_pulp_density = 1 . 68676 ; On execution, we get: + --------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | silica_concentrate | silica_concentrate_confidence | Info | + --------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 . 68 | 0 . 99 | { \"predicted_value\" : \"1.68\" , \"confidence\" : 0 . 99 , \"confidence_lower_bound\" : null , \"confidence_upper_bound\" : null , \"anomaly\" : null , \"truth\" : null } | + --------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 81 sec ) As you can see, the model predicted the silica concentrate for our data point. Again we can see a very high confidence due to the limited dataset. When making predictions you can include different fields. As you can notice, we have only included the first 7 fields of our dataset. You are free to test different combinations. In the previous example, we have made a prediction for a single data point. In a real scenario, you might want to make predictions on multiple data points. In this case, MindsDB allows you to Join this other table with the Predictor. In result, you will get another table as an output with a predicted value as one of its columns. Let\u2019s see how to make batch predictions. Use the following command to create the batch prediction. SELECT collected_data . iron_feed , collected_data . silica_feed , collected_data . starch_flow , collected_data . amina_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_flow , collected_data . ore_pulp_ph , collected_data . ore_pulp_density , predictions . silica_concentrate_confidence AS confidence , predictions . silica_concentrate AS predicted_silica_concentrate FROM process_quality_integration . process_quality AS collected_data JOIN mindsdb . process_quality_predictor AS predictions LIMIT 5 ; As you can see below, the predictor has made multiple predictions for each data point in the collected_data table! You can also try selecting other fields to get more insight on the predictions.

Filtering Spam Emails \u00b6 Anyone with an email address has experienced it, you open your inbox to find a random email promising a cash reward if you click now. Or maybe it\u2019s sneakier, a tracking link for a package you don\u2019t remember ordering. Spam emails are annoying for anyone, they clutter your inbox and send unnecessary push notifications, but they can be security risks as well. Whether a malicious tracking link in an official looking email, or a phishing scam asking you to confirm credentials, Spam emails are a serious concern for any IT department. Luckily, modern email clients have robust spam filters which remove potentially harmful emails from the inbox and label them as spam. Many major email providers use Machine Learning to analyze incoming emails and determine whether or not they are spam. Let's take a look at how MindsDB can be used to do this from a dataset of about 4600 emails. Upload the Dataset File \u00b6 If you are planning on using MindsDB to make predictions based on your own dataset, you probably have that data in a database, in which case you would want to follow the steps described in the Getting Started Guide , mentioned in the prerequisite section, to connect MindsDB to your database. For this tutorial we will be using the MindsDB cloud editor. If you haven\u2019t familiarized yourself with it, now is a great time to do so. From the main page in the editor, select the \u201cUpload File\u201d button in the top right corner. Then from the new page, browse local files and select the correct Spam Emails CSV, name it appropriately (in this tutorial we use spam_predict), and select the \u201cSave and Continue\u201d button. When the upload is complete it should take you back to the main editor page with something like this in the query box: --- MindsDB ships with a filesystem database called 'files' --- Each file you uploaded is saved as a table there. --- --- You can always check the list tables in files as follows: SHOW TABLES FROM files ; Selecting the \u201cRun\u201d button in the top left corner, or pressing Shift+Enter, will run the query and you should see a list of all files uploaded in the bottom section. Create A Predictor \u00b6 For this particular dataset each row represents a single email, with each column representing the frequency of a given word or symbol in that email. There are also columns for the total, average, and longest run of capital letters throughout the email. First we need to switch to using the mindsdb database. USE mindsdb ; We will start by training a model with the CREATE PREDICTOR command using all columns from the dataset we uploaded. CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb . spam_predictor FROM files ( SELECT * FROM spam_predict ) PREDICT Spam ; We can check the status of the model by querying the name we used as the predictor. As this is a larger dataset, the status may show \u201cGenerating\u201d or \u201cTraining\u201d for a few minutes. Re-run the query to refresh. SELECT * FROM mindsdb . predictors WHERE name = 'spam_predictor' ; When the model has finished training the status will change to \"complete\".

Make Predictions \u00b6 We will now begin to make predictions about whether a given email is spam using the model we just trained. The generic syntax to make predictions is: SELECT t . column_name1 , t . column_name2 FROM integration_name . table AS t JOIN mindsdb . predictor_name AS p WHERE t . column_name IN ( value1 , value2 , ...); For our prediction we will query the spam, spam_confidence, and spam_explain columns from the spam_predictor model we trained. To simulate a test email we will provide values for several in the WHERE clause representing various word frequencies and capital letter runs. SELECT spam , spam_confidence , spam_explain FROM mindsdb . spam_predictor WHERE word_freq_internet = 2 . 5 AND word_freq_email = 2 AND word_freq_credit = 0 . 9 AND word_freq_money = 0 . 9 AND word_freq_report = 1 . 2 AND word_freq_free = 1 . 2 AND word_freq_your = 0 . 9 AND word_freq_all = 2 . 4 AND capital_run_length_average = 20 AND word_freq_mail = 1 AND capital_run_total = 20 AND capital_run_longest = 20 ; On execution, we get: + -------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | spam | spam_confidence | spam_explain | + -------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 | 0 . 956989247311828 | { \"predicted_value\" : \"1\" , \"confidence\" : 0 . 956989247311828 , \"anomaly\" : null , \"truth\" : null } | + -------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ With this output we can see that MindsDB predicts that this is a spam email with approximately 96% accuracy. You can change these values and add additional word frequency columns to the query as you see fit to get different predictions. Batch Predictions \u00b6 In the example above, we saw how we can use MindsDB to determine if a single email is spam, however, in a lot of cases we want to determine if any email in an inbox is spam. We can do batch predictions using the JOIN command. By joining our spam_predictor table on a query of our dataset, we can see MindsDB prediction for each row alongside the actual spam value for each email. The generic syntax to do this is: SELECT t . column_name1 , t . column_name2 FROM integration_name . table AS t JOIN mindsdb . predictor_name AS p WHERE t . column_name IN ( value1 , value2 , ...); As we are using the original dataset, which contains 58 columns, we will only include a few of them. The important column for the purposes of this tutorial is the \u201cspam\u201d column for both tables, which we can use to check the predictions accuracy. SELECT t . word_freq_internet , t . word_freq_email , t . word_freq_credit , t . word_freq_money , t . word_freq_report , t . capital_run_length_longest , t . spam , p . spam AS predicted_spam FROM files . spam_predict AS t JOIN mindsdb . spam_predictor AS p ; On execution, we get: + --------------------+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------------+-------+----------------+ | word_freq_internet | word_freq_email | word_freq_credit | word_freq_money | word_freq_report | capital_run_length_longest | spam | spam_predictor | + --------------------+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------------+-------+----------------+ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9989 | 1 | 1 | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 99 | 1 | 1 | | 0 | 0 . 21 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 99 | 1 | 1 | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 99 | 1 | 1 | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 99 | 1 | 1 | + --------------------+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------------+-------+----------------+ With the ability to scroll through all 4600 rows, broken up 100 per page.
